   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-storage.js --network DuckChainTestnet
   ```


# Using Foundry

**Setting up the environment**

Foundry is a smart contract development toolchain. It can be used to manage dependencies, compile a project, run tests and deploy smart contracts. It also lets one interact with blockchain from the CLI or via Solidity scripts.

**Install Foundry**

If you have not installed Foundry, go to [book.getfoundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) and select **Installation** from the side menu. Follow the instructions to download **Using Foundryup**.

Next, select **Creating a New Project** from the sidebar. Initialize and give your new project a name: `forge init zkevm-sbt`In case of a `library not loaded error`, you should run the below command and then repeat the above process again:

```
brew install libusb
```

If you have never installed Rust or need an update, visit the website [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).\\

**Build a project and test**

Run the command `forge build` to build the project. The output should look something like this:Successful forge build commandNow, test the build with `forge test`Testing Forge BuildYou can check out the contents of the newly built project by switching to your IDE. In case of VSCode, just type: `code .`

**Writing the smart contract**

1. Find the [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) in your browser, and use the wizard to create an out-of-the-box NFT contract.
   1. Select the `ERC721` tab for an NFT smart contract.
   2. Name the NFT and give it an appropriate symbol. Example: Name `SoEarly` and Symbol `SOE`.
   3. Go ahead and select features for your token. Simply tick the relevant boxes.
   4. You can tick the **URI Storage** box if you wish to attach some image or special text to the token.
2. Open your CLI and install dependencies with this command:

```
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable
```

1. Remap dependencies to easy-to-read filenames with the command:

```
forge remappings > remappings.txt
```

1. Inside the new `remapping.txt` file, rename the referencing `openzeppelin-contracts` to `openzeppelin`, which is the name used when importing. That is, change `openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts` → `openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts`.
2. Copy the smart contract code in OpenZeppelin: **Copy to Clipboard**
3. In the IDE, open a new `.sol` file, name it and paste the copied code to this file. This is in fact the actual smart contract for the NFT.

**Add control on token transfers**

The aim here is to put rules in place stipulating that the token cannot be transferred without burning it.

* Go to the [OpenZeppelin documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/).
* Look up the signature by searching for `_beforetokentransfererc721`.
* Scroll down to `ERC 721` and copy the corresponding text on the right side:

```
_beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 firstTokenId, uint256 batchSize) internal
```

* Create a new function in the code for the smart contract token called `_beforeTokenTransfer`

```
function _beforeTokenTransfer (address from, address to, uint256 firstTokenId, uint256 batchSize) internal override {
    require(from==address(0) || to==address(0), "Soulbound: cannot transfer");
    super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, firstTokenId, batchSize);
}
```

**Set a token URI (optional)**

A token URI is a function that returns the address where the metadata of a specific token is stored. The metadata is a `. json` file where all the data associated with the NFT is stored. Our aim here is to attach some images to the created token.The stored data typically consists of the name of the token, brief description and URL where the image is stored.

* Choose an image and give it a name relatable to the token
* Find some free of charge IPFS storage for the image, like [NFT.STORAGE](https://nft.storage/)
* Upload the image to the storage using your GitHub account

**Add URI json file**

This is the file that contains the metadata for the token which includes the image address (i.e., the IPFS address of the image).

* In the IDE, create a new `.json` file which you can call `tokenuri.json`
* Populate the `tokenuri.json` file with the token-name, description and URL where the image is stored:

```
{
    "title": "So Early",
    "description": "I was super duper early to the Duck Chain",
    "image": "<IPFS address>" /* remove the forward-slash at the end of the URL, if any */
}
```

* Upload the `tokenuri.json` file to the same storage where the image was uploaded
* Copy the address to the `Sbt.sol` inside the `safeMint` function
* Remove the `uri` parameter so as to hardcode it. This makes all tokens have the same `uri` image, but every consecutively minted pair of tokens will differ by 1 in numerical value of their `tokenId`.

**Populate the `.env` file**

In order to deploy on the DuckChain Testnet, populate the `.env` file in the usual way. That is,

* Create a `.env.sample` file within the `src` folder
* Populate `.env.sample` file with your `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` and the DuckChain Testnet’s `RPC URL` found [here](https://diary.duckchain.io/developer-testnet/network-information/testnet). So the `.env.sample` file will look like this:

```
RPC_URL="https://testnet-rpc.duckchain.io"
PVTKEY="<insert private key here>"
```

* Copy the contents of the `.env.sample` file to the `.env` file,

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

Warning

Make sure `.env` is in the `.gitignore` file to avoid uploading your `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`.

**Deploy your contract**

1. In the CLI, use the following command to ensure grabbing variables from `.env`:

```
source .env
```

1. Check if the correct `RPC URL` is read from the `.env` file:

```
echo $RPC_URL
```

1. You can now use the next command:

```
forge create --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY src/{ContractFile.sol}:{ContractName} --legacy
```

1. which executes the following:
   1. Does a `forge create`.
   2. Passes the `RPC_URL` and `PVTKEY`.
   3. References the actual smart contract.
2. For example, when deploying the `Sbt.sol` contract, the command will look like this:

```
forge create --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY src/Sbt.sol:SoEarly --legacy
```

The above command compiles and deploys the contract to the DuckChain Testnet. The output on the CLI looks like this one below\.Successful Deploy Sbt.sol

**Check deployed contract in explorer**

* Copy the address of your newly deployed contract (i.e. the `Deployed to:` address as in the above example output).
* Go to DuckChain Testnet Explorer, and paste the address in the `Search by address` field.
* Check `Transaction Details` reflecting the `From` address, which is the owner’s address and the `To` address, which is the same `Deployed to:` address seen in the CLI.

### Aggregation Layer&#x20;

The Aggregation Layer is central to DuckChain’s operation, serving as a bridge between th e TON blockchain and DuckChain’s advanced features.&#x20;

* This layer includes the **Decentralized Oracle Layer (DOL)**, which ensures that DuckChain’s state is verifiable on the TON blockchain, enhancing transparency and system credibility.
* **Decentralized Asset Verify Layer (DAVL)** facilitates the secure flow of assets between TON and DuckChain using mechanisms like multi-signature wallets and proposal reviews to ensure transaction integrity and liquidity.
* **Intent Collaboration Layer translates** user intents into executable transactions, aggregating on-chain and off-chain liquidity data while ensuring compliance and execution monitoring. This layer also utilizes Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) to define standardization and facilitate seamless interoperability among smart contracts.

### Execution Layer

Built on Arbitrum Orbit technology this layer provides DuckChain with its unparalleled scalability and efficiency. This layer achieves high throughput and rapid finality, enabling developers to deploy applications that can handle millions of transactions without bottlenecks.\
\
Moreover, this layer ensures that DuckChain remains fully compatible and secure within the Telegram ecosystem, allowing for efficient consensus building and rapid dispute resolution.

### Data Layer

This layer ensures that all blockchain data is stored efficiently and securely. By leveraging distributed storage technologies, the Data Layer provides enhanced data access speeds and reliability while maintaining the integrity and traceability of all transactions and operations on DuckChain.


# 3.2 Framework

DuckChain’s framework is a high-performance, multi-layered system designed to ensure seamless inter-chain communication, transaction handling, and absolute data integrity.\
\
By leveraging the power of Arbitrum Orbit and advanced synchronization mechanisms, DuckChain transforms complex cross-chain interactions into efficient, transparent, and secure processes.

At the core of the framework lies the ability to handle a multitude of user requests and cross-chain operations while maintaining synchronization with the TON blockchain. This is achieved through a series of carefully orchestrated steps:

### **1. Activation of Demand**

When a user initiates a request—whether it’s an asset transfer or another transaction—the Decentralized Oracle Layer (DOL) takes charge. This layer acts as the primary receiver of the user’s intent and routes it to the Intent Collaboration Layer, where the process begins to take shape.

### **2. Message Parsing and Indexing**

Within the Intent Collaboration Layer, the received messages are broken down into actionable components, parsed meticulously, and deeply indexed. These indexed messages are then securely stored in the DuckChain Data Layer, creating a structured repository that ensures efficient management and retrieval. Once parsed, the messages are sent to the Execution Layer, where the real stuff happens.

### **3. Root Hash and Message Synchronization**

The DOL works in tandem with the Decentralized Asset Verify Layer (DAVL) to ensure synchronization between DuckChain and the TON blockchain.\
\
By transmitting root hash values, a cryptographic snapshot of DuckChain’s global state—this system enables TON to verify the execution status of messages in real-time. This synchronization is the backbone of trust and transparency within the DuckChain ecosystem.

### **4. Consensus Building**

To ensure the security and accuracy of cross-chain communication, the DAVL and Execution Layer collaborate to generate consensus trees and root hash values.\
\
These cryptographic proofs are validated by network validators using smart contracts, creating a tamper-proof record of all transactions. The result is a strong system that guarantees consistency across all participants.

### **5. Transaction Execution**

Once validated, the system moves into execution mode. Smart contracts within the Execution Layer handle the finalization of operations, whether that involves completing an asset transfer or fulfilling a more complex request. Parameters are passed seamlessly, ensuring smooth, efficient execution without the need for manual intervention.

### **6. Root Hash Transmission**

The DOL transmits the updated root hash from the Execution Layer back to the TON blockchain. This ensures that TON can independently verify DuckChain’s state at any given moment, maintaining consistency and reinforcing trust in the system.

### **7. Transaction Monitoring and Rollback**

The framework’s resilience is exemplified by its advanced monitoring and rollback capabilities. If a transaction fails, the Aggregation Layer and Execution Layer jointly analyze the issue. Unexecuted operations are automatically identified and either retried or rolled back, ensuring asset security.
