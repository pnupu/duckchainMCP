Welcome to DuckChain x AWS Hack: AI Unchained
Welcome to the global online hackathon at the frontier of AI Agents and Decentralized Infrastructure. Co-hosted by DuckChain, the telegram AI Chain, and Amazon Web Services, the leading cloud and AI infrastructure provider, this 1-week virtual event brings together the brightest minds from the AI, Web3, and agentic computing ecosystems.

Whether you're building autonomous agents, AI-powered dApps, or decentralized model inference systems, this is your launchpad.

With robust support, generous bounties, and expert mentorship, AI Unchained invites you to shape the future of permissionless intelligence.

Let‚Äôs build a world where AI is not only intelligent, but decentralized.

Tracks
AI Agent & Autonomous Apps: Build chain-aware agents that can perceive, decide, and act autonomously with on-chain feedback loops.
Decentralized AI Infra: Create infra to train, store, or run AI models in a decentralized way. Includes DePIN, federated learning, etc.
AI-as-a-Service on Chain; Develop token-incentivized APIs or services like inference engines, AIGC image/text tools, etc.
DuckChain Native Tools: Use DuckChain‚Äôs infra to build dev tools, social protocols, or data solutions for onchain AI apps.
Judging criteria
Submissions will be evaluated based on the following dimensions, with an emphasis on how effectively AI is integrated into decentralized, agentic applications:

Innovation & Creativity (25%)
AI-Native Design: Does the project creatively leverage AI agents, LLMs, or model inference pipelines in ways that go beyond basic chatbot functionality?
Web2 ‚Üí Web3 Transition: Does it help onboard traditional users into decentralized AI workflows? Are tools or UX patterns introduced to lower barriers?
‚ÄúWOW‚Äù Factor: Does the project leave a strong impression through its creativity, design polish, or AI performance? Is it something people would talk about or share?
Technical Feasibility & User Experience (35%)
Project Completion (15%) Is there a fully working demo, deployed prototype, or well-documented GitHub repo? Are core features functional and well-tested?
Technical Challenge (10%) Does the project address a hard AI or infrastructure problem (e.g., decentralized model execution, AI-agent coordination, zkML)? Are DuckChain and AWS services used in non-trivial ways?
User Experience (10%) Is the interface intuitive for AI interaction? Is prompt/response flow seamless? Do agent actions or feedback loops feel natural and effective?
DuckChain Ecosystem Fit (20%)
Duck Identity (5%) Does the project creatively integrate DuckChain‚Äôs playful "duck" brand into its AI personality, design, or naming conventions?
Duck Token Utility (15%)
Does the project provide meaningful utility for the $DUCK token? For example:Using $DUCK for accessing or upgrading AI agent capabilitiesStaking $DUCK to influence agent behavior or decision-makingIncentivizing decentralized compute, data contribution, or moderation via $DUCKEnabling in-agent economies (e.g., tips, fees, rewards, credit systems) The more native and impactful the $DUCK token use, the higher the score.
Sustainability & Business Model (15%)
Roadmap (8%) Does the team present a clear path forward for the AI agent/app? How will they maintain or scale decentralized AI workloads?
Sustainable Model (7%) Is there a monetization or incentive model, such as agent-as-a-service, microtransactions, or DuckStar-based economics?
