# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

*ChainGPT uses NLP algorithms to understand, process input, and generate relevant answers.*

Natural language processing is a fundamental building block for establishing human-grade communication models. It is a system for interpreting arbitrary/abstract text/speech inputs that do not lend themselves to uniform structures to produce relevant outputs.&#x20;

The model of human communication is a messy one. The lingual variance in the syntactic, semantic, phonetic, and lexical styles people use cannot be quantified; there will be as many unique communication styles as there are personalities.&#x20;

Therefore, to establish coherent communication between man and machine, NLP frameworks have been developed around fundamental principles that are consistently found in all forms of communication.

Those principles revolve around parsing, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and text tokenization.&#x20;

ChainGPT‚Äôs application of NLP in its AI system takes in human language input, comprehends the intention/request/prompt, and responds accurately. Crypto, blockchain, and Web3 are all novel, radically evolving domains of knowledge that garner cross-cultural interest. Given that the informational density of their respective subject matters spans broadly, the NLP algorithms in ChainGPT‚Äôs AI will help with being able to to translate inputs and produce coherent, contextually aware responses effectively

# Machine Learning (ML)

*Machine learning is the field of knowledge upon which modern artificial intelligence systems are built.*&#x20;

As the name might have hinted, machine learning is, at its core, the construction of methods in which computers can recursively educate and advance their comprehension of certain subjects.&#x20;

Based on neural networks that replicate human thought processes, ML is an aggregation of complex algorithms that can distill abstract principles into tangible mathematical formulas. Concepts such as linear regression, clustering, and random forest structuring are examples of decision-making techniques that are utilized to make learning possible.

Depending on who you ask, there are three general classes of learning models: Supervised, Unsupervised, and semi-supervised, each containing a multitude of hybrid alternative sub-models (reinforcement, temporal, etc.) within them.

ChainGPT‚Äôs AI leverages all of the leading open standards in machine learning to optimize its model‚Äôs aptitude to evolve alongside ingesting new data.

[**Disclaimer**](/chaingpt-v1-docs/misc/legal-docs/disclaimer)


# Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning is key to the optimization of an AI model's functionality.

From the collection of data to the refinement of it to the processing and production, fine-tuning is an iterative process that selectively extrapolates portions of an AI‚Äôs operation and effectively re-trains it to increase the fidelity of its outputs.

Typically implemented through a supervised learning approach where human intervention is required in order to pinpoint discrepancies and guide the AI to understand desired outputs.

As it relates to ChainGPT, fine-tuning is conducted on a regular basis by the development team that is monitoring the qualitative state of ChainGPT. Additionally, fine-tuning may be implemented ad hoc in sudden critical, logical lapses.

\---

[**Disclaimer**](/chaingpt-v1-docs/misc/legal-docs/disclaimer)


# Generative Model

The portion of AI technology that pertains to the output/result of processes.

Generative models replicate the human faculty of creativity by detecting patterns, correlations, and disjunctions to produce novel outputs/responses.

Currently, the major use case of converting text-based inputs into text, visual, and audio outputs; generative models have found incredible applications across various fields of artistic outlets, including short-form copywriting, long-form storytelling, website design, branding, and even oil canvas painting and software code.

ChainGPT synthesizes the best qualities in open-sourced models to derive its own unique generative capabilities for its chatbot conversations, smart contract creation, and NFT generation.

\---

[**Disclaimer**](/chaingpt-v1-docs/misc/legal-docs/disclaimer)


# Pretrained Language Model

Pre-trained language models are artificial intelligence schemes that utilize existing databases of knowledge to seed their operational/functional understandings.

Just as when a child is born, the language, culture, and upbringing that shape its worldview dictate the results in the capacity and development of that child.&#x20;

The higher quality of initial input a child receives early on in life strongly impacts that childs capacity of achievement and social disposition later in life.&#x20;

The same applies to AI machines when using pretrained language models; the information used to instantiate its knowledge base will shape the information it produces as well as the rate of its development and the kind of development it has

ChainGPT‚Äôs AI has seeded its model with enormous volumes of crypto, blockchain, and Web3 industry data. Therefore, by possessing deep domain expertise, ChainGPT‚Äôs AI will mature in tandem with the direction that is shaped by the greater industry. While it may be an absolute master of degen economics and distributed ledger technology, it would not be best suited as a resource for the manufacturing of clothing.

# Transformer Architecture

Transformer architecture refers to the specific neural network design uncovered and implemented by Google's AI team, Google Brain.

Superseding its predecessor architecture known as RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), transformer architecture is an adaptive approach to data processing. Rather than sequencing steams of information in chronological strings, transformer architectures process entire blocks of data simultaneously and substitute form factors to optimize data coherence.

Rooted in identifying core concepts by accurately allocating its focus, transformer architecture displaces excessive processing by applying four components: Attention Mechanisms, Multi-head Attention, Feed-Forward Layers, and Normalization Layers.&#x20;

ChainGPT makes good use of the transformer architecture in the design of its AI by allowing users the ability to provide theoretically unlimited input requests and being able to handle them aptly.

[**Disclaimer**](/chaingpt-v1-docs/misc/legal-docs/disclaimer)


# Tokenization

Within the realm of artificial intelligence, tokenization refers to the transformation of information into portions/bits of recurrent data.&#x20;

Known as Byte-pair encoding, tokenization is basically breaking down text strings into micro-batches of characters and tagging them so that they can be adeptly stored and understood by the binary functions of a computer.

Consider the combination of the three letters *i-n-g*. Each letter is an independent token; however, when put together to form ‚Äú*ing,*‚Äù they take on a wholly different representation that is commonly found at the tail end of past tense actions (end-ing, mean-ing, vot-ing, etc.).&#x20;

Taking this a step further, within the three characters, you will also see the ability for a multitude of two-letter combinations for tags such as ‚Äúig,‚Äù ‚Äúng,‚Äù ‚Äúgi,‚Äù and so on. Each combination of the letters would be its own unique token. By tokenizing every possible combination of the individual letters, it becomes easier to recognize patterns in large datasets rather than processing each letter individually. For situations where ‚Äúin‚Äù would arise, we know that if the two letters are detached from any other letters, then it would classify as a word; however, if they are included with other letters, then we can ignore the word take and operate on the sentence structure more accurately.

[**Disclaimer**](/chaingpt-v1-docs/misc/legal-docs/disclaimer)


# Contextual Awareness

Contextual awareness is the ability to assimilate an accurate interpretation of information based on the ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù within which it is presented.

Context imbues meaning into sentences and defines high-level human processing. The context can change the meanings of terms and give insight into the essence of any message's purpose.

As it relates to artificial intelligence, contextual awareness is the ability of an AI model to extrapolate information on a situational basis that considers more variables that are visibly present, a process called inference, where the machine infers information that is not directly expressed.&#x20;

ChainGPT maximally benefits from the high degree of contextual awareness baked into its AI model, allowing it to understand requests based on the nature of the request rather than just the words used.

## About $CGPT [Utility Token](https://docs.chaingpt.org/overview/iv.-cgpt-utility-token)

<details>

<summary>What is $CGPT token? </summary>

$CGPT, or ChainGPT Token, is the utility token powering the ChainGPT ecosystem. ChainGPT is a futuristic AI chatbot designed to assist individuals, developers, and businesses with anything related to Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies.&#x20;

**Some of the key features and use cases of the $CGPT token include:**

1\. Access to ChainGPT services: Token holders can use $CGPT to access various ChainGPT services such as AI-generated news, AI smart contract generator and auditor tools, AI NFT Generator, Launchpad, and more.

2\. Staking and Farming: Users can stake and farm their $CGPT tokens.

3\. Governance: $CGPT token holders have governance rights, allowing them to participate in voting on important decisions and proposals related to the development and future of ChainGPT.

4\. Discounts and exclusive features: Holding $CGPT tokens may grant users discounts on certain services within the ChainGPT ecosystem and access to exclusive features.

The total supply of CGPT is 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. It is currently deployed on the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) network, with plans to expand to other networks like Ethereum, Polygon Matic, Avalanche, and more in the future.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I get $CGPT? </summary>

There are two ways to acquire $CGPT tokens: buying and earning. \
\
Buying: $CGPT is listed across a multitude of partnering exchanges (CEX and DEX); for a list of all tradeable markets, please check [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chaingpt/#Markets). \
\
Earning: ChainGPT is constantly hosting trading competitions with $CGPT incentives.

Please ensure you're using the correct smart contract address for CGPT when interacting with decentralized exchanges: 0x9840652DC04fb9db2C43853633f0F62BE6f00f98. Always double-check the contract address to avoid scams or fake tokens.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What blockchain network is $CGPT deployed on?</summary>

The $CGPT token is a BEP-20 standard token on the Binance smart chain. It has also been deployed on the Ethereum network as an ERC-20. As the project matures, the token will be bridged to other EVM-compatible chains.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is $CGPT's Supply Policy?</summary>

Fixed maximum supply with deflation via burn.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does $CGPT's Burn Mechanism work? </summary>

The $CGPT token incorporates a burn mechanism as a pivotal element of its economic policy, aiming to systematically reduce the circulating supply and induce scarcity. Here's how it operates within the ChainGPT ecosystem:

1. **Burning Process**: Tokens are permanently removed from the circulating supply by sending them to a non-spendable, void address on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) - `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.
2. **Application**: Every commercial-grade transaction within ChainGPT has a burn component, ensuring that every user interaction directly contributes to the health and growth of the $CGPT ecosystem.
3. **Key Burn Touchpoints**:
   * **Prompt Marketplace**: All fees are subjected to a 100% burn, ensuring they are entirely removed from circulation.
   * **Chatbot & Tools**: 50% of the fees from the Chatbot and related AI tools are burned, with the other half allocated to the ChainGPT Foundation and DAO Treasury.
   * **AI NFT Generator (NFT Gen)**: 50% of the associated fees are burned, while the remainder is split between the ChainGPT Foundation and DAO Treasury.
   * **ChainGPT Pad**: For every Initial Dex Offering (IDO) hosted on the ChainGPT Pad, 1% of the raised amount is utilized to buy back $CGPT tokens from the market and burn them.
   * **Whitelabel Solutions**: When other companies or projects purchase whitelabel solutions or licenses from ChainGPT, 10% of the total transaction value is used for a $CGPT market buy-back and burn.
   * **ChainGPT NFT Collection Sales**: For direct NFT sales by ChainGPT, 20% of the proceeds go towards buying back and burning $CGPT tokens.
4. **Token Allocation**: Any $CGPT tokens reverted to ChainGPT or the DAO are evenly distributed between them. These funds are reinvested in development, marketing, community engagement, and other initiatives to further ChainGPT's growth.
5. **Impact Thesis**: The deliberate reduction of circulating tokens amplifies scarcity, boosting market velocity and potentially positively influencing the token's valuation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I use ChainGPT without spending $CGPT?</summary>

Yes, ChainGPT offers multiple ways to access its utilities without directly spending $CGPT. You can leverage the "Freemium" model by staking CGPT, which provides enhanced AI access at no additional cost.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is the $CGPT Contract audited?</summary>

Yes, $CGPT has dual audits from [Certik](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/chaingpt) and [Hacken](https://hacken.io/audits/chaingpt/).

<details>

<summary>Why stake $CGPT?</summary>

Staking serves four crucial functions within the ChainGPT Ecosystem. Firstly, it offers individuals free and unlimited access to ChainGPT without spending their $CGPT tokens with each request. Second, in order for businesses and developers to build commercial products with the ChainGPT API, they must commit to a pool of $CGPT tokens, which will serve as the reservoir of purchasing power for their API requests. Third, $CGPT staking provides access to the ChainGPT DAO. Fourth, $CGPT staking is necessary to accumulate tier points to access the ChaingGPT Pad.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does ChainGPT have a prompt base?</summary>

Our prompt marketplace will be made available after the v1.0 release. Access can be found on the application [dashboard](https://app.chaingpt.org/).

<details>

<summary>Do I have to pay the network fees in order to interact with ChainGPT?</summary>

General interactions such as single generations are free and do not require any fees.

Interactions such as minting NFT's, staking, trading, etc. will require the appropriate gas fees to interact on chain.

Please note, users with 200,000 staking points (CGPTsp) will receive diamond tier, in turn giving them Freemium access to our products. This will not cover on-chain network fees as these are not within our control. Learn more about Freemium [here](https://www.chaingpt.org/pricing).

</details>

# AIVM Blockchain Whitepaper

The New Era of Blockchain AI is Here

## AIVM ***(Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine)*** Whitepaper: The Layer-1 Infrastructure for a Transparent, Scalable AI Economy

***

### 1. Introduction

#### Transforming AI Through Decentralization

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming every facet of human life, from industry to infrastructure, communication to creativity. Yet access remains unequal. Costs keep rising. Trust continues to erode. While model capabilities advance rapidly, the critical enablers - compute power, data ownership, and training infrastructure - are held by a powerful few. This concentration stifles competition. It slows progress. And it limits who gets to build the future. We believe in a new, decentralized approach.

**AIVM (AI Virtual Machine) is that approach - an open platform purpose-built to decentralize the AI stack**. It brings transparency. It improves security. It redistributes opportunity. By fusing the reliability of blockchain with the needs of next-gen AI workloads, AIVM reimagines how intelligence is created, verified, and deployed at scale. We see intelligence as a shared resource - not a private asset, not a corporate black box, but an open marketplace, where innovation can flow freely and equitably. AIVM is how we build that future.

***

### 2. Executive Summary

The AI industry is reaching a critical junction where progress collides with control, and possibility is constrained by centralization. Few companies lead. Many are locked out. Costs are unsustainable. The result is an ecosystem where only a select few can meaningfully participate in AI‚Äôs evolution. This cannot scale. It won't last. And it certainly won‚Äôt serve humanity. That‚Äôs where AIVM enters.

AIVM is building a decentralized infrastructure that addresses the four structural challenges limiting AI‚Äôs potential. Access is restricted. Decision-making is opaque. Costs are prohibitive. And current solutions are fragmented. We solve these with a comprehensive, blockchain-native platform engineered for the full AI lifecycle.

1. **Verifiable AI Execution** introduces cryptographic proofs of model execution (as a process) to restore trust in AI outputs. No more black boxes. No blind faith. No unprovable claims. This feature ensures transparency without sacrificing data privacy or performance.
2. **Decentralized Resource Marketplace** unlocks access to computing resources beyond major cloud providers. A permissionless compute network allows developers to source compute from global infrastructure operators. No intermediaries, no inflated margins, no vendor lock-in. Competition drives efficiency, making AI development more affordable and scalable.
3. **Open Model Ecosystem** empowers developers and researchers to launch and monetize models directly. Faster launches. Wider reach. Direct user relationships. This disintermediation supports both niche models and frontier innovations that would otherwise struggle to scale through traditional channels.
4. **Integrated Infrastructure** provides cohesion where fragmentation once existed. Unlike siloed tools, AIVM unifies deployment, validation, and compute management into one composable system. Less friction. More trust. Better performance. This holistic design enhances interoperability and drives network effects.

AIVM‚Äôs underlying architecture supports these capabilities with purpose-built mechanisms. A dual-path execution model lets simple models run transparently on-chain while directing complex workloads off-chain to specialized nodes. Validator specialization ensures efficient scaling and verification - some validators verify execution, others monitor compute quality, while another group maintains data integrity. Adaptive security mechanisms calibrate protection based on workload criticality, balancing performance and resilience. Finally, cross-chain interoperability enables integration with multiple blockchain environments, extending AIVM's reach and enabling collaboration across decentralized ecosystems.

### 4. Market Landscape & Opportunity

The convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain marks one of the most significant technological intersections of our time. AI is scaling fast. Costs are high. Access is limited. Meanwhile, blockchain offers a path to transparency, openness, and decentralized control. To understand AIVM‚Äôs positioning, we must examine how AI evolved, what centralization has cost us, and why decentralized infrastructure offers a powerful alternative.

#### 4.1 AI Industry Evolution

Artificial intelligence has moved from a research frontier to a global driver of productivity and innovation. Growth has surged. Use cases have multiplied. Demand continues to rise. AI is now embedded in healthcare, finance, logistics, and entertainment, reshaping how decisions are made and services are delivered. The industry is maturing. But so are its challenges. And many of those challenges come from structural imbalances rooted in centralization.

The global AI market was valued at $184 billion in 2024 and is forecasted to exceed $1.5 trillion by 2030, with a CAGR of more than 38%. This explosive growth stems from better model architectures, increased compute availability, broader enterprise adoption, and a shift from narrow AI tools to general-purpose systems. These forces combined are pushing AI deeper into the infrastructure of modern life. The momentum is undeniable. But the benefits are unevenly distributed. And the control is held by very few.

Today, five major companies dominate over 80% of the cloud AI infrastructure market, while three foundation model providers account for about 75% of model deployments. This concentration limits who can participate. It locks out smaller players. It creates dependency. Training powerful models like GPT-4 can cost upwards of $100 million in compute alone, putting such development beyond the reach of most startups and independent labs. Barriers are mounting. Resources are scarce. And access to training data is increasingly controlled by platform giants.

The issue is about systemic control. Large platforms now operate across the full stack: from chips to models to APIs, squeezing out specialists and reducing interoperability. Innovation slows. Vendor lock-in intensifies. The result is a fragile ecosystem where power is consolidated and resilience is reduced. Developers must build within pre-existing frameworks. Enterprises face limited pricing options. And users often interact with opaque models whose behavior can‚Äôt be explained or challenged.

These dynamics lead to four major risks: innovation bottlenecks, pricing inefficiencies, transparency gaps, and security vulnerabilities. Each of these risks compounds the others. They increase friction. They decrease trust. And they stifle the inclusive growth that AI should enable. From research teams to enterprises to everyday users, the impact is widespread. The status quo is not sustainable.

In response, a new model is emerging at the intersection of AI and blockchain. The "AI crypto economy" applies decentralized principles‚Äîtransparency, verifiability, and incentive alignment‚Äîto various aspects of AI infrastructure. It‚Äôs growing fast. It‚Äôs generating interest. But most current projects only solve isolated problems. Compute marketplaces like Akash or Bittensor connect hardware providers to users, but lack optimizations for AI inference or training. Model-sharing platforms like Ocean Protocol enable data exchange, but offer little in terms of runtime verification or execution guarantees. On-chain AI projects are often constrained by blockchain performance limits and don‚Äôt scale to real-world workloads.

These early efforts signal strong demand for an alternative approach but they also reveal the need for a more integrated system. AI workloads are complex. They‚Äôre performance-sensitive. They demand trust and flexibility. AIVM is being designed to meet these needs through a full-stack, purpose-built platform. It goes beyond point solutions. It connects the dots. And it aims to do so at scale.

#### 4.2 The Decentralization Opportunity

The push for decentralized AI is structural, strategic, and deeply practical. Centralized models are increasingly brittle. Risks are compounding. Systems are strained. Decentralization offers both a safety valve and a superior design. And the timing has never been better.

**Five major trends are converging to open the window for decentralized AI infrastructure.**&#x20;

* **First:** AI Adoption Momentum is rapidly accelerating. Enterprises are moving from exploration to execution. Demand is rising. Generic APIs are no longer enough. Businesses want domain-specific models they can understand and trust. Model capability is increasing, and so is market expectation.
* **Second:** Blockchain Technology Has Matured to the point where it can now support real-world AI integration. Cosmos-based chains can process 500+ transactions per second, making them viable for off-chain coordination. Cross-chain bridges are thriving, with over $12 billion in monthly asset transfers. Smart contracts now go far beyond DeFi‚Äî43% of recent deployments are in non-financial applications, opening the door to intelligent automation.
* **Third:** Demand for Verifiable AI is surging, especially in regulated industries. Financial institutions, healthcare providers, and public-sector organizations need auditability. Executives need traceability. Compliance mandates are growing. Model governance has become a boardroom topic, not just a backend concern.
* **Fourth:** Democratization of Compute and Models is finally materializing. Open-source model ecosystems are growing. Community-driven development is thriving. And decentralized compute providers are beginning to rival cloud incumbents in flexibility and cost. Specialized contributors can now build, share, and monetize without corporate gatekeepers.
* **Fifth:** Advancements in Privacy-Preserving Computation are enabling sensitive data to be used safely in distributed environments. Zero-knowledge proofs can now handle AI-level complexity. Federated learning allows model improvement without data aggregation. And hardware enclaves offer secure environments for execution without compromising performance.

Together, these trends create a structural shift in the AI landscape. Businesses want more flexibility. Developers want more control. Users want more privacy. Regulators want more transparency. The market is ready for a new kind of infrastructure.

AIVM‚Äôs Positioning is defined by its comprehensive approach. While others focus on discrete pain points, AIVM integrates model deployment, resource allocation, execution verification, and incentive alignment into one modular system. The platform is designed for real workloads. It optimizes for trust. It scales through composability. AIVM doesn‚Äôt just respond to today‚Äôs market‚Äîit anticipates where the entire AI infrastructure stack is heading.

### 5. AIVM Platform Overview: The Decentralized AI Engine

Traditional AI infrastructure promises openness while often enforcing exclusion. Power is centralized. Access is limited. Trust is assumed, not earned. AIVM introduces a new paradigm where AI development, deployment, and monetization occur in an open, verifiable, and incentive-aligned environment. This is the engine of decentralized AI.

#### 5.1 Core Technology Proposition: Building the Foundation

When we assessed today‚Äôs blockchain and AI ecosystems, one truth stood out: neither is fully equipped for the other‚Äôs needs. General-purpose blockchains are underpowered. AI platforms lack transparency. Verification is scarce. This mismatch led us to design AIVM‚Äîa platform purpose-built to execute, verify, and scale AI across a decentralized network.

#### **AI-First Blockchain Architecture**

Running complex AI directly on a general-purpose blockchain is like trying to render 3-D graphics in a spreadsheet: the ledger records every step flawlessly, but it isn‚Äôt built to crunch the heavy math. AIVM supplies that missing compute layer. Built on the Cosmos SDK, it acts like a high-performance engine with specialized modules tailored for AI workloads.

At the core is the AI Module, the system‚Äôs control center. It manages model lifecycles. It tracks performance. It verifies results. Think of it as the protocol‚Äôs digital cortex housing the Model Registry, a secure and immutable index of all models published, updated, and executed on the platform.

Complementing this is the Compute Module, which acts as an intelligent matchmaker. It pairs AI tasks with hardware. It assesses resource fit. It monitors performance in real time. Similar to how Uber matches passengers to drivers, this module ensures tasks are routed to the best available node for the job.

The Data Module provides integrity and access control. It safeguards sensitive inputs. It ensures permissioned use. It creates verifiable records of information flow. In a world of increasing AI regulation, this is key infrastructure for trust.

Together, these modules unlock capabilities that general-purpose chains can‚Äôt offer. They form the technical bedrock on which decentralized AI can truly scale.

#### Dual-Path Execution Framework: Bridging Two Worlds

AIVM introduces a dual-path execution system that intelligently balances transparency and performance. Workloads are routed based on complexity. Lightweight models go on-chain. Heavy models go off-chain. The system chooses the optimal route in real time.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcFgi6OmbMW1wzIihfWZTVvx1GClfkJdjGEP0-VTq_2aTn2ljdoDK8XU-E20AVhhnB2z9IrLBcCvfJzzII1DyiX8LQmP2_1BShvRqZDf58x-u8FhNTO8LXcof-6lu409cHrImh_?key=clL35lb0wqJhereprFdC-cjh" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### The Transparency Path: On-Chain Execution

For simple, explainable models, AIVM supports full on-chain execution. This means every input, process, and output is visible to all. No secrets, ambiguity or guesswork. Consensus-driven validation and real-time auditability provide provable accountability.

Applications here include credit scoring, on-chain risk assessment, DAO proposal evaluation, and governance intelligence. These models benefit from transparency. They need no extra hardware. And they work well within blockchain performance limits.

#### The Performance Path: Verified Off-Chain Execution

For complex AI, AIVM offloads execution to high-performance nodes. Models are run in secure environments. Cryptographic correctness verification. Hardware attestation confirms the trustworthiness of the node.

This path powers LLMs, computer vision systems, dynamic pricing engines, and simulation-heavy agents. It maintains performance. It preserves trust. And it logs every operation‚Äôs outcome and proof on-chain for permanent reference.

By combining these two paths, AIVM solves the blockchain/AI performance paradox, enabling verifiability without sacrificing capability.

#### Trust Through Verification: Beyond the Black Box

Most AI systems today are opaque. Users must trust that the output is accurate. They have no way to verify it. AIVM replaces trust assumptions with verifiable execution, secured through a multi-layered framework.

Cryptographic proofs mathematically verify model outputs. Hardware attestation confirms secure, isolated execution environments. Multi-party verification introduces redundancy as multiple validators cross-check results. And the blockchain stores every proof, creating an immutable audit trail.

This structure replaces black-box assumptions with provable guarantees. It ensures users no longer have to rely on vendor reputation alone. Trust becomes technical, not transactional.

#### 5.2 Key Stakeholder Benefits: Creating Value Across Ecosystems

AIVM‚Äôs architecture serves multiple stakeholder groups, aligning their incentives through real economic mechanisms. Each role gains distinct advantages. Each interaction creates value. And every contribution reinforces the network‚Äôs strength.

#### Enterprises: Trusted AI Without the Black Box

Enterprises face growing friction with AI adoption. Regulations are tightening. Trust is fragile. Costs are high. AIVM delivers verifiable execution, giving businesses the evidence they need to demonstrate fairness, compliance, and reliability.

Access to a decentralized compute marketplace offers pricing efficiency. Integration flexibility reduces vendor lock-in. And audit-ready logs simplify risk oversight. A financial institution, for example, could deploy a risk-scoring model with proof that it operates fairly, meeting both performance and compliance needs.

#### Developers: Building Without Barriers

For AI developers, barriers are everywhere. Compute is expensive. Distribution is gated. Monetization is limited. AIVM unlocks new opportunities: usage-based compensation, direct marketplace listing, and transparent benchmarking.

Developers can access flexible compute from independent providers. They can publish modular models for reuse. They can earn as their models are used, not just when they‚Äôre licensed. This creates a more equitable path to innovation.

#### Resource Providers: Sustainable Economics

Anyone with hardware can participate in the AIVM ecosystem. GPUs. CPUs. Storage. Idle capacity becomes income. Providers earn by running models, verifying outputs, or contributing datasets.

Reputation-based incentives reward consistent quality. Token-based compensation enables real-time payouts. Infrastructure operators can also earn by hosting key network functions. This turns infrastructure into capital‚Äîefficiently, transparently, and at scale.

#### 5.3 Platform Capabilities: A Complete AI Ecosystem

**AIVM doesn‚Äôt just offer parts‚Äîit delivers a full-stack ecosystem optimized for decentralized AI.**

#### Executing and Verifying Any AI Model

The platform supports flexible model architectures, from neural nets to transformers. Lightweight models run on-chain. Heavy models execute off-chain with verification. Each task gets the optimal performance-to-trust ratio.

From single-step inference to multi-stage reasoning, the system adapts. Verification adjusts based on criticality. AI models become both useful and provable‚Äîat scale, and with confidence.

#### Decentralized Resource Marketplaces

AIVM includes native marketplaces for compute, models, and data. Compute providers post available resources. Developers match their workloads. Pricing is dynamic, driven by demand and supply.

Model creators can publish reusable components. Data providers can monetize curated datasets with privacy-preserving controls. These marketplaces reduce friction. They increase fairness. And they incentivize value creation.

#### Interoperability Framework

AIVM integrates with Cosmos chains via IBC. It supports external blockchain bridges and leverages oracles for real-world data.

This means AIVM models can inform Web3 apps. They can enhance DeFi, DAOs, and even traditional systems. It‚Äôs not just a silo‚Äîit‚Äôs connective tissue for AI across blockchains.

#### 5.4 Application Domains: Solving Real-World Problems

**AIVM‚Äôs unique capabilities support mission-critical use cases across industries.**

### 6. Technical Architecture

AIVM‚Äôs architecture transforms decentralized AI execution from theory to implementation. It combines the Cosmos SDK framework with AI-optimized modules. Dual-path execution optimizes for both transparency and complexity. Specialized validator roles maintain verifiability without throughput compromise. Cryptographic security layers protect models, data, and results across environments. Resource allocation is dynamic, market-driven, and reputation-based. Storage solutions balance blockchain anchoring with scalable distributed systems. Each component is engineered to meet the practical demands of decentralized AI at scale.

#### 6.1 Core Execution Framework

AIVM uses a dual-path execution model optimized for AI task diversity. Simple models run directly on-chain via the Direct State Model (DSM). Complex models execute off-chain under the Parametric Execution Model (PEM). DSM stores and executes AI models fully within validator nodes, subject to block gas and storage limits. On-chain executions are optimized through quantization, pruning, and distillation to meet blockchain constraints. PEM routes heavier models to secure enclaves where execution proofs are generated. These cryptographic proofs validate model correctness without re-executing computations. Results, proofs, and attestation metadata are immutably recorded on-chain.

DSM supports fully transparent operations suited for lightweight inference models. PEM supports complex, performance-intensive models like LLMs and computer vision pipelines. Both models guarantee traceability, immutability, and public verifiability of AI executions within the AIVM environment.

#### 6.2 Core Modules and Validator Structure

AIVM extends the Cosmos SDK with four AI-specific modules. The AI Module governs model lifecycle management and execution records. The Compute Module matches workloads with computational resources dynamically. The Data Module handles access rights, data integrity, and flow audits. The Registry Module maintains mappings between models, validators, and providers. Each module integrates cryptographic state proofs to ensure tamper-evident operations. Validators are specialized by domain function with separate selection tracks. Selection is based on staked tokens, capability metrics, and operational performance history. Validator incentives are aligned through slashing risks and staking rewards.

Core Validators ensure consensus; AI Validators check model integrity and execution correctness. Compute Validators verify hardware claims and SLA adherence; Data Validators audit data sources and permissions. Specialized validators increase throughput by parallelizing verification across operational domains.

#### 6.3 Security Architecture and Verification Layers

AIVM enforces security through a layered three-zone model. Privacy-Critical workloads operate in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Performance workloads use hardware-secured GPU computing for near-native throughput. Public Verification workloads execute directly on-chain for complete auditability. Hardware attestation, cryptographic proof generation, and multi-party validator consensus work in tandem. Zero-knowledge proofs are applied selectively to balance performance with privacy. Signature aggregation reduces verification overhead without compromising security. Execution correctness is established before any result is accepted on-chain.

Workloads produce continuous attestation trails linking model, hardware, execution, and outputs. These trails are permanent, cryptographically verified, and publicly inspectable without requiring trusted third parties.

#### 6.4 Decentralized Resource Marketplace

AIVM connects AI workloads with distributed computational resources via an open marketplace. Providers are categorized into high-performance, standard, and entry-level tiers based on GPU capability. Workload routing dynamically matches model requirements to available, qualified resources. Pricing adjusts according to provider reputation and real-time supply-demand conditions. SLA agreements enforce success rates, response times, and availability standards automatically. Provider reputation scores are computed from performance metrics and continuously updated. Slashing penalties apply for repeated SLA violations or misbehavior. Reputation impacts both marketplace visibility and earnings potential for providers.

Market dynamics create efficient allocation, while decentralized enforcement mechanisms sustain service quality without centralized control.

#### 6.5 Storage Architecture

AIVM implements a hybrid on-chain and off-chain storage model. On-chain storage records model metadata, permission structures, and execution proofs. Off-chain distributed storage holds large binaries like model weights and training datasets. Cryptographic hashes link every off-chain object to immutable on-chain identifiers. Validators periodically check content availability and integrity against registered hashes. Access control is enforced at both storage and execution stages through smart contracts. Lightweight models critical to governance or compliance operate entirely on-chain. Larger models leverage IPFS or compatible networks for distributed, tamper-resistant storage.

This architecture enables scalable AI operations without sacrificing verifiability, transparency, or access security.

#### 6.6 Cross-Chain Interoperability Roadmap

AIVM‚Äôs architecture supports future cross-chain integration via standardized communication protocols. Native IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) enables Cosmos-based ecosystem interactions securely. Research is underway into EVM-compatible bridging models with threshold validation safeguards. Oracles may eventually facilitate bidirectional data exchange between off-chain systems and AI models. Execution request relaying and cross-chain proof validation are planned for later phases. Strict security normalization ensures external integrations uphold AIVM's cryptographic guarantees. All interoperability components are gated behind phased testing and governance review processes. Deployment decisions prioritize security, auditability, and operational resilience over speculative expansion.

Cross-chain extensions will allow AIVM models to serve multi-chain ecosystems with verified intelligence outputs.

#### 6.7 Technical Specifications Summary

AIVM executes AI workloads using deterministic on-chain paths or cryptographically verified off-chain paths. Validator specialization improves throughput, accuracy, and system resilience under operational loads. All storage interactions anchor data integrity via blockchain-registered cryptographic proofs. Resource allocation is decentralized, dynamic, and governed by real-time market conditions with SLA enforcement. Security architecture layers hardware isolation, cryptographic proofs, and multi-party validation to achieve high assurance. Interoperability plans follow security-first development roadmaps aligned to maturing cross-chain standards. Modular extensibility ensures that evolving AI, cryptography, and decentralized infrastructure innovations can be integrated as the platform scales.

### 8. Tokenomics & Economic Model

The AIVM token economy (powered by $CGPT) is designed to align incentives across participants, sustain network operations, and facilitate efficient resource allocation. Token utility derives directly from platform usage and core infrastructure requirements.

#### 8.1 Token Utility and Value Capture

The AIVM token has four primary functions: staking, transaction fees, governance, and marketplace settlement.

* **Staking** secures network operations at two levels. Core Validators stake tokens to participate in consensus and receive block rewards. Specialized Validators for AI, Compute, and Data operations stake tokens as security deposits against misbehavior. Delegators can delegate tokens only to Core Validators, earning a share of validation rewards without operating infrastructure.
* **Transaction fees** are payable exclusively in the platform token. Basic transaction fees apply to operations such as token transfers and governance actions. AI execution fees vary with computational complexity, while storage fees cover on-chain storage of models, proofs, and metadata. Cross-chain operation fees apply to interactions with external blockchain ecosystems.
* **The token** enables governance participation by requiring deposits for proposal submissions and proportional voting rights based on staked amounts. Governance can adjust key network parameters, including fee distribution ratios, and validator slashing penalties.
* In the **resource marketplace**, the token serves as the medium for compute resource payments, model usage fees, and data access compensation. Marketplace payments create a direct link between resource consumption and token demand.

{% hint style="info" %}
Value accrual is driven by transaction fees, which will be used to incentivize network participants. A dynamic minimum fee algorithm adjusts base transaction fees based on network utilization, maintaining cost-efficiency during normal conditions and protecting against spam during congestion. Resource marketplaces operate through auction-based matching systems that prioritize providers based on price, capability, and reputation.
{% endhint %}

#### 8.2 Economic Flow Dynamics

Economic flows within AIVM involve users paying transaction fees and resource costs, rewards distributed to validators and delegators by the network, protocol-driven incentivize mechanisms subsidizing security, and the community pool funding ecosystem development.

Settlement mechanisms optimize transaction throughput. Batched settlements aggregate payments to reduce on-chain load, while off-chain payment channels handle high-frequency microtransactions with periodic reconciliation. Cross-chain settlement enables users to interact with AIVM using assets bridged from external ecosystems.

Marketplace pricing uses a dynamic auction mechanism that adjusts to supply and demand, factoring reputation into match prioritization. This creates efficient resource allocation and incentivizes reliable provider behavior.

#### 8.3 Technical Integration with Existing Systems

Cross-chain interoperability is achieved through native IBC token transfers within the Cosmos ecosystem and secure bridge protocols for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Support for wrapped assets allows users to maintain value in external tokens while interacting with AIVM infrastructure.

For enterprise users, fiat on-ramp APIs simplify token acquisition, treasury management tools assist with operational integration, and predictable pricing packages offer budgetary certainty. These systems facilitate enterprise adoption without altering the core token-based architecture.

AIVM integrates with decentralized oracle networks to stream real-time data that underpins its economy: live price feeds against major fiat and crypto pairs, cost benchmarks versus traditional cloud-compute providers, and macro metrics such as inflation. These feeds enable accurate token valuation, cross-currency operations, and data-driven governance of economic parameters.

#### 8.4 Economic Sustainability Mechanisms

Resource marketplace scaling is supported by targeted incentives. Early providers benefit from initial reward multipliers, reliable providers receive premium reputation-based bonuses, and specialized hardware operators gain access to higher-value workloads.

Governance retains control over key economic parameters including fee splits, reward schedules, minimum transaction fees, and validator slashing penalties. Parameter flexibility allows the system to respond to evolving network conditions without external intervention.

Long-term token value growth is driven by increased network usage, expanded marketplace activity, and verifiable AI operations, not speculative incentives. Token demand scales naturally with platform adoption, maintaining alignment between ecosystem growth and token utility.

***

Core Validators maintain consensus, Service Providers (AI, Compute, Data) bring operational expertise, and Token Holders represent the broader community. This ensures that both technical and user-centric perspectives guide protocol evolution.

Domain-specific governance covers AI model standards, compute resource management, and data governance. Each domain can adjust parameters independently while maintaining system-wide consistency, aligning governance participation with technical specialization.

#### 9.2 Proposal and Voting Systems

Governance decisions flow through a structured proposal system supporting Parameter Changes, Software Upgrades, Text Proposals, and Domain-Specific Adjustments. Each proposal undergoes validation, community voting, and, if approved, automatic execution.

Voting power is based on staked tokens, adjusted by network contributions such as service quality. Proposals must meet minimum quorum, approval, and veto thresholds, preventing low-participation decisions and protecting against malicious changes.

#### 9.3 State Management and Execution

All governance-approved changes implement atomic, forward-only state transitions. Proposals either fully execute or fail validation, preventing inconsistent states. Historical states remain immutable, enabling full auditability of protocol evolution without risking chain integrity.

#### 9.4 Smart Contract Integration

Governance updates flow through a Registry and Gateway pattern that manages contract access control, execution routing, and cross-contract consistency. This ensures governance decisions can securely and reliably modify any part of the system architecture.

#### 9.5 Service Provider Governance

AIVM maintains governance-defined quality standards for AI services, compute resources, and storage. Providers must pass capability verification, security validation, and ongoing performance monitoring to remain eligible. Standards evolve through governance based on operational needs and technological advancement.

#### 9.6 Emergency Procedures

AIVM includes structured emergency protocols for rapid incident response. Monitoring systems detect anomalies, security breaches, and performance deviations, triggering coordinated mitigation measures and transparent status communication without disrupting system integrity.

#### 9.7 Protocol Evolution Mechanisms

Governance enables continuous parameter optimization, coordinated software upgrades, and phased integration of emerging technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs. System upgrades are scheduled to prevent fragmentation and maintain backward compatibility, ensuring safe, predictable innovation.

* **Governance Capture:** Concentrated control could threaten neutrality. AIVM balances voting power with contribution-based modifiers, implements domain-specific governance, protects minority rights with veto thresholds, and promotes transparent proposal analysis.
* **Upgrade Coordination:** Protocol upgrades risk fragmentation. Scheduled upgrade coordination, backward compatibility, rigorous pre-upgrade testing, and phased rollouts ensure seamless evolution without network splits.

#### 10.4 Market Risks

* **Resource Pricing Volatility:** Price instability could deter adoption. AIVM stabilizes the resource market through reputation-weighted pricing, adjustable sensitivity factors, long-term contracts, and resource class differentiation.
* **Quality of Service:** Decentralized providers could underperform. AIVM enforces SLAs with economic penalties, uses continuous performance monitoring, reputation-based routing, and token-based security deposits.
* **Market Liquidity:** Low participation could create resource shortages. Resource standardization, reputation incentives, automatic conversion mechanisms, and initial foundation-backed provisioning ensure healthy liquidity across service categories.

#### 10.5 Technological Risks

* **Hardware Dependency:** Reliance on TEEs or specific hardware could pose systemic risks. AIVM mitigates this through multi-layered security, diversified technologies, defense-in-depth strategies, rapid upgrade mechanisms, and operational fallback modes.
* **AI Model Evolution:** Future AI architectures could outpace the system. AIVM‚Äôs modular model architecture, dual-path execution flexibility, governance-based adaptation pathways, and proactive research integration ensure long-term platform relevance.
* **Oracle Reliability:** Oracles introduce external trust assumptions. AIVM uses multi-source verification, cryptographic oracle signatures, stake-based accountability, and data freshness constraints to secure external data feeds.

#### 10.6 Risk Management Framework

AIVM implements continuous risk monitoring across system performance, security, market dynamics, and governance activity. Progressive decentralization transitions responsibility from the foundation to the community over time. Regular third-party audits, penetration tests, formal verification, and hardware security assessments reinforce system integrity.

This option is best suited for results that require individual, specific attention. Whether you are an artist expressing your thoughts or a business needing abstract imagery, the Single NFT generator can cater to complex demands and deliver high-quality results.

**Option 2: Collection**

The Collection option is optimized for use cases that require large batches of unique art. Prominent applications include ticketing and community building. Rather than mass-printing redundant copies of tickets, you can provide your audience with distinguishable designs for their tickets. When building communities, generating collections from a single prompt ensures a visual bond that unites all members under the same principle.

* Collection size varies with a maximum cap of 10,000 images per request.

#### Prompting <a href="#prompting" id="prompting"></a>

The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator is designed to turn abstract ideas into visually compelling NFTs. There‚Äôs no rigid formula for writing the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù prompt ‚Äî creativity is your best tool. That said, clear and descriptive prompts typically yield more accurate and refined results.

Prompts can be anything from literal, like ‚ÄúWhite Rhino in Space,‚Äù to imaginative and surreal, like ‚ÄúObsidian god wearing jewelry in a mansion.‚Äù The model is built to understand nuance, so don‚Äôt worry too much about spelling or grammar ‚Äî it gets it.

**Need a boost?**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Web**: <https://app.chaingpt.org/> | **Telegram**: <https://t.me/ChainGPT> | [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/chaingpt)
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FIFE4PA0tiq6aCmUlYFBx%2FIMG_20250227_110932_804.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=767a3932-0d0f-4d19-9e75-340d9b558ba1" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Smart contracts are the fundamental building blocks of decentralized applications. The development of Smart contracts is the cornerstone upon which Web3 relies to bring the vision of a decentralized, digital economy to fruition.&#x20;

Coding a smart contract from scratch is a labor-intensive, detail-oriented process that commonly includes extensive time expenditures in the quality assurance processes before deployment.  Aimed at accelerating innovation and improving prototyping quality by order of magnitude, ChainGPT has tuned the capabilities of its AI model to create smart contracts on demand.

ChainGPT's AI Model has been fed all of the information about smart contract code, including best security practices, libraries, samples of standardization, effective live contracts, failures, and a slew of micro-nuances (such as solidity syntax).&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FuNDqTMlEDrhBKpu1DzOJ%2Fspotlight%20on%20dappbay.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=cb0f9be3-8c1f-4bc0-ac2d-0aa81ef6925c" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

# AI Smart-Contract Auditor

An added layer of Pre-emptive security for Smart Contracts

{% hint style="info" %}
**Web**: <https://app.chaingpt.org/> | **Telegram**: <https://t.me/ChainGPT> | [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/chaingpt)
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FHMLgMGa6ZggfR7xHDcQr%2FScreenshot%202025-02-27%2012.37.06.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3152e6f8-da24-41de-ae81-54c9a0afb1fc" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In Web3, code is law. Mistakes are to be avoided at all costs. The permanence of data that has materialized in software with the advent of blockchain and distributed ledger technology has amplified the importance of security in open, global economic settings.

Accuracy in developing smart contracts or decentralized applications could be the difference between a catastrophic bug exploit costing users billions and the establishment of powerful neutral intermediaries. Every year, the amount of capital expended on providing security to digital assets grows. Under the premise that society will only continue to ascend into a more digital version of itself, the need to secure smart contracts will continue to grow.&#x20;

The  ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor takes code as input and run a multitude of evaluations based on the vast history of the crypto/blockchain/Web3 industry's information set and detect potential dangers or anomalies before having to deploy contracts.

**Auditing Smart-Contracts was never easier!**

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FsaV044OJb2rFsmVUs8nI%2FXnip2025-02-27_13-23-54.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=cc45ae83-2732-4003-9118-962562078c96" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Benefits:

* **Pre-emptive security enhancement:** Security has three touchpoints: time, preventative, monitoring, and post-event/reactive. Preventative deals with the model of security that attempts to maximize safety during development to minimize any potential issues in the future. Monitoring refers to the time of a security measure's life cycle when essential maintenance is conducted to ensure all functionality runs as it should and deter malicious activity in real time. Post-event or reactive security models deal with recovery speed after something goes wrong.  ChainGPT's auditor can help prevent issues from arising and increase the quality of code before it is deployed into production.&#x20;
* **Additional Layer of Security:** The ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor seamlessly integrates into a product's development workflow. It heightens the confidence level around a code's quality to help streamline DevOps.
* **Time-Efficient:** Audits are notoriously time-consuming. While the ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor does not guarantee the same granularity and nuance as a cybersecurity expert, it is an incredible way to filter for fundamental errors within seconds. From code upload to prompting the request to conduct a thorough scan, it is simply a matter of a few minutes. In less than the time it takes the Bitcoin network to print a block, the ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor can complete an analysis.
* **Capital Efficient:** It is not uncommon for an essential security evaluation to run costs into the multiple thousands. ChainGPT's Auditor implements a simple, fixed cost (per call/prompt) model that decreases these costs by up to two orders of magnitude.&#x20;
* **Cross-chain Safety**: The ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor audits smart contracts deployed on multiple blockchains, including **BNB Chain**, **Berachain**, **Ethereum**, **Arbitrum**, **Avalanche**, **Solana** and many more. This provides options for our community and further enhances on-chain safety and due dilligence.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: You can audit your smart contracts directly in the chat box on the Auditor page. We've this interface intuitive and user-friendly, meaning you can get your smart contracts to a high quality with low hassle. With just a few prompts you'll be up and running in no time!

{% hint style="info" %}

Built with advanced AI algorithms and leveraging insights from leading security providers, CryptoGuard provides the comprehensive protection you need.

### **Installation Guide**

To install CryptoGuard, visit [this link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cryptoguard-by-chaingpt-a/eegoohfobcaegoeoakafgiljckfiajhl) and add to your browser. After installation, make sure to navigate to the ‚ÄòMy Wallet‚Äô tab to analyze your wallet.

### **Supported Blockchains**

CryptoGuard currently supports BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon.

## Features

By incorporating insights from [CUBE3.AI](https://cube3.ai/), GoPlusSecurity, EtherScan, and BSCScan, CryptoGuard establishes a comprehensive security framework. The extension is divided into four main features. In the following documentation, we‚Äôll review each and detail their functionality.

1. Analyze Anything
2. My Wallet
3. Live Tracker
4. URL Analysis

***

### **Analyze Anything**

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2Fxx5QRJAoRGNSXCTqByl0%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a4984ce1-6cb9-48b2-ae0a-f0e655f830ff" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

CryptoGuard allows users to analyze malicious websites, transactions, tokens, and NFTs against wallet addresses. From wallet addresses to transaction hashes, quickly analyze and assess potential risks to make informed security decisions. Let‚Äôs review the four main features of this tab.

### **Analysing Wallet Address**

When a user enters a wallet address for analysis, the following information is generated:

1. Transactions associated with the wallet address
2. NFT collections owned by the wallet address
3. Tokens held by the wallet address

### **Analysing** Transaction Hash

In the Transaction Hash tab:

* Clicking on the details icon provides two types of information for each transaction: General Info and Alerts.
* Transactions labeled "No Risk" indicate no potential issues. The number of warnings and high-risk alerts are displayed for transactions with warnings. Alerts from three APIs are displayed to determine the transaction's risk level.
* From and To wallet addresses, transaction hash, and gas fee are displayed.
* Click to view the transaction in a block explorer and copy the transaction ID.
* Risks: Alerts indicating whether a transaction is risky are shown in Risks next to the info section within the Info Dropdown.

### **Analysing Website**&#x20;

Users can enter any website URL to check its safety status:

* Whitelisted, blacklisted, or other categorized URLs are checked against a file.
* If the URL is not in the file, the IP Quality Score API is called to determine if the site is suspicious.

### **Analysing Token Address**

For token analysis:

* Details such as supply, symbol, market cap, price change, and volume are analyzed.
* Warnings and high-risk labels are displayed, with further breakdown available in the dropdown.

***

## **My Wallet**

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FcmdqET8W8Hquf5oaasZ1%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a1ba577d-7f2e-4d38-9d6c-abda66f4da53" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Using CryptoGuard, you can achieve peace of mind with a detailed security overview of your Web3 wallet and assets. The My Wallet tab allows users to view transactions, NFTs, and tokens associated with their connected wallet address. If suspicious tokens or NFTs exist, CryptoGuard will assign them a warning.

### **Transactions**

In the Transaction tab:

* Each transaction provides general information and alerts.
* Transactions labeled "No Risk" indicate no potential issues, while warnings are displayed for risky transactions.

### **NFTs**

In the NFTs tab:

* Collections of NFTs associated with the wallet address are displayed.
* Users can click on a collection to open it in OpenSea.

### **Tokens**

In the Token Tab:

* Tokens held by the wallet address are analyzed and labeled by risk level.
* Alerts are available in the dropdown for further details.

***

## **Live Tracker**

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FRG72eaB9r8lZZNkBWyZZ%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3807f9c3-7750-4c7b-937d-9d17fbb23cd4" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Get instant feedback about transactions from our Live Tracker. CryptoGuard analyzes wallet addresses and instantly alerts you to suspected fraud before confirming. In the settings tab, users can activate the Active mode for Tracker:

* This enables detailed analysis of transactions, popping up on each transaction.
* Users can wait for analysis or skip it. If the selected chain is unsupported, the user is informed.

### **Tracker Details**

* Provides transaction details and alerts.
* Further analysis and contract details are available in dropdown menus.
* Users can access other functionalities like "Analyze Anything" and "My Wallet" from within the Tracker window.

***

## **Website Analysis**

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FgVAU7ucjqzBKo2SaTO76%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=29fe5c7b-1661-43c3-9ef4-4e48a045adb5" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

CryptoGuard‚Äôs URL Analysis feature is a powerful tool that systematically scans website URLs for potential threats. With real-time checks against our extensive repository of malicious sites and the IP Quality Score API, users can confidently navigate Web3.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

* Malicious websites are identified, allowing users to continue or exit.
* A repository of whitelisted sites is compared to visited URLs.
* The IP Quality Score API is called to assess the site's trustworthiness if a URL is not in the repository.

# Web3 Safety Toolkit

Web3 is celebrated for its decentralization, immutability, and useful smart contracts. However, despite these advanced features, blockchain users still face significant vulnerabilities related to cybersecurity.

ChainGPT has developed this simple guide to help users navigate these threats and equip themselves with effective defensive tools.

### **Common Threats to Web3 Users:**

* Phishing attacks trick users into giving up sensitive information, such as private keys and seed phrases, which are crucial for transactions and wallet recovery. For instance, in 2021, over 6,000 Coinbase users were tricked into revealing their details through sophisticated phishing schemes.
* Malicious Smart Contracts: These are coded to misappropriate funds unsuspecting users deposit. Examples include approval contracts that grant hackers access to your tokens, liquidity pool contracts that block fund withdrawals, and deposit contracts that divert your crypto to a hacker‚Äôs wallet.
* The 51% Attack: Occurs when a group controls over half of a blockchain's computing power, allowing them to alter transactions and disrupt network integrity. This threat is particularly severe for smaller networks.
* Crypto-jacking: Crypto-jacking involves unauthorized use of someone else‚Äôs computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. This type of attack leads to performance degradation and can persist undetected.
* Advanced Persistent Threats (APT): These attacks are complex and are conducted over long periods, aiming to steal sensitive data from networks or subtly disrupt operations.

### **Tools for Enhanced Security:**

* Hardware Wallets: Essential for anyone serious about cryptocurrency, these devices store private keys offline, safeguarding them from online thieves. Obtaining these wallets from reliable vendors and following a rigorous setup process is critical.
* Secure Browsers and VPNs: Secure browsers help to minimize personal data exposure online, while VPNs are indispensable for securing data on public networks and encrypting connections to prevent interception.

### **Best Practices:**

* Remain vigilant and conduct regular security checks on websites and emails to avoid phishing and other scams.
* Keep your security software and hardware up to date to defend against the latest threats and vulnerabilities.

By embracing these security practices, users can enhance their protection against the evolving risks in the Web3 landscape. We recommend [CryptoGuard](http://cryptoguard.ai), our AI-powered Web3 security tool that fights back against hackers and protects your assets.


# Crypto Wallet Security 101

Effective management and protection of digital assets in Web 3.0 necessitate a thorough understanding of wallet types and security features. Selecting the right storage option and implementing robust security measures are vital to safeguarding your investments.

### **Types of Wallets:**

* Custodial Wallets: Third-party services offer these wallets, which manage your private keys and transactions. While convenient, they expose users to risks if the provider's security is compromised.
* Non-Custodial Wallets: These give users complete control over their assets by allowing them to manage their private keys and transactions directly. This independence increases security but also places greater responsibility on the user.

### **Wallet Security Practices:**

* Hardware Wallets: These devices, which often resemble USB drives, provide a secure way to manage private keys and perform transactions. Their physical nature requires anyone attempting to access the wallet to have the device in hand, greatly reducing the risk of online theft.
* Hot Wallets: These digital wallets are more accessible and vulnerable to security threats. Strong security protocols, such as robust passwords and two-factor authentication, are vital.

### **Common Vulnerabilities and Prevention:**

* Phishing: A common tactic where attackers impersonate legitimate services to steal credentials.
* Malware Attacks: These can infiltrate devices through downloads or deceptive links. Maintaining updated anti-malware software is crucial.
* Bugs in Wallet Software: Developers frequently update wallet software to fix vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.

These guidelines can significantly strengthen your crypto wallet's defense against potential security threats. We recommend [CryptoGuard](http://cryptoguard.ai), our AI-powered Web3 security tool that fights back against hackers and protects your assets.

\\


# Recognizing and Avoiding Scams in Web3

Though Web3 offers exciting opportunities, it also presents numerous risks, with scammers actively exploiting unwary users. In 2023 alone, scams accounted for losses of over $290 million.

### **Common Scams:**

* Phishing: Scammers create fake websites or send misleading emails to trick users into revealing sensitive information, which can lead to significant financial loss.
* Rug Pulls: Occur typically in new cryptocurrency projects where developers suddenly withdraw all funding, leaving a worthless project behind. This scam often follows a pattern of excessive hype and rapid investment withdrawal.
* Ponzi Schemes: These schemes promise high returns and rely on new investors' funds to pay returns to earlier participants, collapsing once the flow of new investors stops.

### **Identifying and Avoiding Scams:**

* Extensive Research: It is critical to investigate the project's team thoroughly, scrutinize the whitepaper, and check for audit reports by respected firms.
* Maintain Skepticism: Exercise caution with projects promising unrealistic returns and verify all information through multiple independent sources.

### **Action Steps if You Suspect a Scam:**

* Documentation: Collect all relevant transaction details and report the matter to appropriate authorities to help mitigate further exploitation.
* Protect Your Investments: If you suspect foul play, immediately move your assets to a more secure environment.

Through diligent research and proactive security measures, you can navigate the Web3 world more safely and avoid falling prey to scams. We recommend [CryptoGuard](http://cryptoguard.ai), our AI-powered Web3 security tool that fights back against hackers and protects your assets.

To acquire the Freemium membership, users must stake $CGPT tokens and accumulate >200,000 CGPTsp (staking points). Once qualifying for the "Freemium" membership, users will also have their ecosystem tiers upgraded to Diamond and be imbued with the rights to submit proposals to the ChainGPT DAO for the community to vote on.

Once per month, members of the "Freemium" plan will have their accounts balanced with 20,000 CGPTc (ChainGPT credits). These credits may be used for any utilities the user desires or can be left unused. They do not roll over, and balances are topped off to the 20,000 CGPTc level.

For example, if you became Freemium in February and had your account filled to 20,000 CGPTc but only used 3,500, your account would be left with 16,500 at the start of March. In March, your account balance will update to 20,000 again. If you do not use the CGPTc, your balance will remain flat month-to-month.

# CGPT Utility Token

ChainGPT's native utility token

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2Fq0h0I1XReD4AEJtIWn2L%2FXnip2025-02-06_11-18-12.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=614e675f-6b1b-456c-a101-45adb096bc5b" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Contract Address**: ([Certik Audit](https://www.certik.com/projects/chaingpt)) ([Hacken Audit](https://hacken.io/audits/chaingpt/))\

**$CGPT (ChainGPT Token) is the economic backbone of the ChainGPT ecosystem.**&#x20;

It acts as a store of value, a unit of account, and a medium of exchange that facilitates all on-chain interaction between individuals and businesses and the ChainGPT AI Model. To access the full range and depth of ChainGPT's Crypto AI Hub, ChainGPT has weaved the $CGPT token into its business architecture.&#x20;

Through careful design considerations, many touch points tie the demand for the AI model to the $CGPT token, from NFT and smart contract generation to auditing and Web3 AI chatbot interactions, and the number of vectors that transmute value through $CGPT is vast.

Beyond the singular utility of access, the token provides ancillary benefits that compound the degree of value end users are imbued with by having exposure to $CGPT.&#x20;

ChainGPT has established a virtuous, transparent economy of AI services that track real-world demand for artificial intelligence by recording all activity on-chain. Moreover, as the asset required for inclusion into the ChainGPT DAO, $CGPT becomes the tool that invites communities of AI enthusiasts and unites them through the power of ownership.

***

### Utilities

* PPU for AI model
* Staking for Priority Access to AI Model Tools
* Membership to the DAO
* Inclusion into a Tier level for ChainGPT Pad and DegenPad

**üîπ Pay-Per-Use (PPU) for AI Model**

A non-binding model for users looking for maximal freedom from commitment and limitless flexibility. Whether engaged via the official interface (application dashboard) or called via the API, every interaction with the ChainGPT AI incurs a usage fee in CGPT Credits (CGPTc).\
Each 1 CGPTc = $0.01 USD and can be acquired by converting $CGPT tokens.

Examples of pricing with CGPTc include:

* Web3 AI Chatbot: 0.5 CGPTc per request
* Smart Contract Auditor: 1 CGPTc per request
* Smart Contract Generator: 2 CGPTc per request
* AI News SDK: 1 CGPTc per API call
* NFT Collection Generator: 2 CGPTc per NFT

This structure offers full pricing flexibility across ChainGPT's ecosystem.

**Staking for Priority Access  to AI Model Tools**\
The Staking system is a core component and key driver of ChainGPT's economic architecture.&#x20;

Synchronized with a four-tier membership system, staking provides unlimited, priority access to the ChainGPT AI model (at the diamond tier). Seen as a form of capital commitment, staking is considered to be a strong signal for supporting ChainGPT while tapping into its vast AI tooling infrastructure. Regarding $CGPT, staking is a form of token binding where users lock their assets out of circulation for a predetermined time.\
[**Stake Here** ](https://app.chaingpt.org/staking)

**Membership to the DAO**\
ChainGPT's decentralized autonomous organization is a member-owned governance forum designed to attract AI enthusiasts from all walks of life and unify them through co-ownership. Joining the DAO imbues users with participation rights (proposing and voting) that help steer the direction of the project developments and protect it against mal-intentioned entities. Enabled through the staking module, members will have a headquarters in cyberspace for coordinating with like-minded technologists, futurists, researchers, developers, and entrepreneurs.\
[**View DAO Here**](https://dao.chaingpt.org/#/)&#x20;

**Inclusion into a Tier level for ChainGPT Pad**\
In order to unlock complete access to the benefits provided by the ChainGPT Pad and access all of the potential projects, users must stake their $CGPT to accumulate tier points. Deduced from a a combination of the amount of tokens staked and the duration they are staked for, users gain different tiers, each with its own degree of unique benefits. \
[<mark style="color:blue;">**View Tier System**</mark>](https://www.chaingpt.org/blog/chaingpt-launchpad-tier-system-staking)&#x20;

**Bridging $CGPT with AIVM**\
Once launched, AIVM will be further powered by $CGPT token to broaden its utility. Those building in the new AI economy can use $CGPT to pay for marketplace fees and covers gas fees on the AIVM network. All will be revealed very soon... \\

\
\* *There are a variety of cost structures associated with the degree of access and user sophistication that will be outlined in the* [*Pricing Guide here*](https://www.chaingpt.org/pricing)*.*

# Tier System & Benefits

ChainGPT's Four Tier Membership Structure

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FeKS2V5E7dS7LU4UgI1HV%2FXnip2025-02-06_11-23-37.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=ce055bb7-83fb-4417-8594-0f09aa5ffb3d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The ChainGPT ecosystem has implemented a four-tiered system. This structure aims to give every $CGPT token holder an equal voice, regardless of their token count. Moreover, it includes rewards suitable for individuals of varied financial backgrounds.

Tiers represent the degree of a user's commitment to the ChainGPT ecosystem as defined by the simple formula of 1) capital in the form of $CGPT tokens and 2) the duration they get locked up for. The more tokens a user stakes, the more CGPTsp they acquire; the longer the duration of the stake, the higher the multiplier on their CGPTsp.

***

### Tier Structure

Four distinct tiers have been established: bronze, silver, gold, and diamond. Every tier has its own CGPT(sp) requirements and provides its own unique set of benefits.

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FeIiN1dotkkujPZxLs0Al%2FTier_Benefits.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ec78117b-8b15-4594-8317-8ac09ef42d1c" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<details>

<summary>ü•â Bronze Tier</summary>

*This entry-level tier is explicitly designed for users with limited capital capacities.*&#x20;

***Points Required:** >2,000+*\
\
\&#xNAN;***ChainGPT AI Ecosystem Benefits:***\
\&#xNAN;*- Freemium AI Tools Access: No*\
*- DAO Voting Rights: Yes*\
*- Can Create DAO Proposals: No*\
*- Free Incubation Airdrops: No*\
*- Early Access to ChainGPT Apps: No*\
\
\&#xNAN;***ChainGPT Pad Benefits:***\
\- *Pool Weight: 1x Allocation Multiplier*\
\- *Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%*\
\- *Participation rounds: #2 (FCFS)*&#x20;

The Bronze tier does not provide access to the ***first/guaranteed round.** M*embers in this tier group are granted the right to only participate in the second/FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve) round. Occasionally, social campaigns (via Gleam / Galxe / TaskOn) will be launched in tandem with new IDO releases that will allow bronze-tier members to earn whitelist allocations for the first rounds.

</details>

<details>

<summary>ü•à Silver Tier</summary>

### ü•à Silver Tier

*Silver is the second level tier and the first one that provides guaranteed access to the first round of participation in IDOs.*

***Points Required:** 20,000+*\
\
\&#xNAN;***ChainGPT AI Ecosystem Benefits:***\
\&#xNAN;*- Freemium AI Tools Access: No*\
*- DAO Voting Rights: Yes*\
*- Can Create DAO Proposals: No*\
*- Free Incubation Airdrops: No*\
*- Early Access to ChainGPT Apps: No*\
\
\&#xNAN;***ChainGPT Pad Benefits:***\
\- *Pool Weight: Minimum 4x Allocation Multiplier*\
\- *Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%*\
\- *Participation rounds: #1 and #2 (Guaranteed and FCFS)*

The most commonly sought-after level due to the inclusion into all IDO rounds. Silver tier members are also granted a guaranteed whitelist placement for the launch of ChainGPT's official NFT collection.

</details>

<details>

<summary>ü•á Gold Tier</summary>

### ü•á Gold Tier

*Gold is the second highest tier and the first one that provides access to premium early-stage crowdfunding and private sales.*

***Points Required:** 50,000+*\
\
\&#xNAN;***ChainGPT AI Ecosystem Benefits:***\
\&#xNAN;*- Freemium AI Tools Access: No*\
*- DAO Voting Rights: Yes*\
*- Can Create DAO Proposals: No*\
*- Free Incubation Airdrops: Yes*\
*- Early Access to ChainGPT Apps: Yes*\
\
\&#xNAN;***ChainGPT Pad Benefits:***\
\- *Pool Weight: Minimum 10x Allocation Multiplier*\
\- *Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%*\
\- *Participation rounds: #1 and #2 (Guaranteed and FCFS)*

In the Gold Tier, benefits for members expand to include opportunities for participating in pre-public stages of new project launches (private sales). Likewise, the Gold tier members will be guaranteed whitelist placements for participating in the official ChainGPT NFT collection launch.

One of the most appealing drivers of the Gold tier is the unlocked IDO allocation claims. For every IDO launched on ChainGPT Pad, a portion of the tokens collected will be distributed among gold & diamond tier members.

</details>

<details>

<summary>üíé Diamond Tier</summary>

*Diamond is the highest and most desirable tier for launchpad participants, given the breadth of benefits it offers. Being the only tier that provides complementary tokens & NFT airdrops, Diamond tier users are reimbursed for their commitments passively.*

***Points Required:** 200,000+*\
\
\&#xNAN;***ChainGPT AI Ecosystem Benefits:***\
\&#xNAN;*- Freemium AI Tools Access: Yes*\
*- DAO Voting Rights: Yes*\
*- Can Create DAO Proposals: Yes*\
*- Free Incubation Airdrops: Yes*\
*- Early Access to ChainGPT Apps: Yes*\
\
\&#xNAN;***ChainGPT Pad Benefits:***\
\- *Pool Weight: Minimum 40x Allocation Multiplier*\
\- *Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%*\
\- *Participation rounds: #1 and #2 (Guaranteed and FCFS)*

As with earlier (non-bronze) levels, members of the Diamond tier receive access to both IDO rounds. Likewise with the preceding Gold Tier, one of the most appealing drivers for Diamond tier members is the unlocked IDO allocation claims. For every IDO launched on ChainGPT Pad, a portion of the tokens collected will be distributed among Gold & Diamond tier members. Of course, the proportional allocation is more significant for higher-tier members.

Diamond tier members also receive additional incentives from the ChainGPT partnership network through priority NFT distributions and private token allocations.

The Diamond Tier is the only one that pushes the benefits beyond the realm of the ChainGPT Pad and into other vectors of ChainGPT's ecosystem, namely Freemium tools and DAO proposal rights.&#x20;

Here, members are automatically granted unlimited access to all ChainGPT AI tools and receive monthly CGPTc balance refills of up to 20,000 credits. Thereby incentivizing membership at his level with ecosystemic participation in every possible manner.

Diamond Tier members also happen to be the only group of community members who are endowed with the ability to submit proposals. While any $CGPT token holder is allowed to participate in steering the outcomes of decisions, only Diamond Tier members can push the suggestions for community deliberations.

# Burn Mechanism

ChainGPT Tokens (CGPT) Burning Mechanism

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FI8b71zRwauL9iSxLtqnT%2Fcgpt_tokenBurn_000.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=24ff7577-cb9f-4381-a897-b1736bc52d16" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Acting as a key component of the $CGPT token's economic policy, burning is the process of reducing the circulating supply by sending the assets to a void, non-spendable address for which the private keys do not exist.

{% hint style="info" %}
*On BNB chain's network (BSC {Binance Smart Chain}) the public void address utilized for this purpose i&#x73;**`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`***
{% endhint %}

## How does the burn apply in ChainGPT?

Burning has been applied to every commercial-grade transaction taking place within the ChainGPT ecosystem. All of the touchpoints at which $CGPT is used for income generation will be tithed to the burn mechanism and, in turn, have every single user interaction contribute to the growth of the $CGPT ecosystem.&#x20;

### The Five Touchpoints of $CGPT's Fee Burn Mechanism

Five different vectors are tied to the burning.&#x20;

**Chatbot & tools:** 50% burn \
\&#xNAN;*Half of all fees attributable to the Chatbot and any adjacent AI tools are removed from the circulating supply. The remaining half is accrued to the ChainGPT Foundation and DAO Treasury.*\
\
**NFT Gen:** 50% burn \
\&#xNAN;*Half of all fees attributable to the AI NFT Generator are removed from the circulating supply. The remaining half accrues to the ChainGPT Foundation and DAO Treasury.*\
\
**Pad:** 1% burn *(from raise amount)*  \
*Whenever a project hosts their IDO on the ChainGPT Pad, 1% of the amount it raises will be used to buy back $CGPT tokens from the open markets and burn them.*\
\
**Whitelabel Solutions:** 10% buy-back & burn \
\&#xNAN;*Every time a B2B transaction takes place where another project or company decides to purchase any white label solutions/software/software licenses from ChainGPT, 10% of the total transaction cost will be used to buy back $CGPT tokens from the open markets and burn them.* \
\
**ChainGPT NFT Collection Sales:** 20% buy-back & burn\
\&#xNAN;*Any time ChainGPT sells its own NFTs, 20% of the proceeds will be used to buy back $CGPT tokens from the open markets and burn them.*

\
Any $CGPT tokens are accrued back to ChainGPT, or the DAO will be distributed proportionately between the two entities and leveraged for purposes of development, marketing, and a slew of ancillary community and brand-building initiatives to propel ChainGPT.\\

### Thesis

By reducing the units of tokens that are in circulation, the immediate pressure of scarcity reflects itself on market velocity, in turn exerting positive upward pressure on the unit valuation of the asset.

### What is CGPTc?

**CGPTc**, or **ChainGPT Credits**, are the units of account and consumption for the ChainGPT ecosystem applications. Every function processed through the ChainGPT AI model requires computational resources. To properly value and account for this usage, ChainGPT employs the CGPTc system‚Äîa stable, credit-based structure that ensures predictable and fair pricing for users.

This fundamental unit serves as a direct measure of a user‚Äôs current **buying power** within the ChainGPT ecosystem.

***

### What is the value of CGPTc?

To ensure maximum simplicity and transparency for users, the value of CGPTc is **pegged at a fixed rate**:

> **1 CGPTc = $0.01 USD**

This stable value holds regardless of the real-time market fluctuations of the $CGPT token. Once $CGPT is converted into CGPTc, the purchasing power remains consistent and predictable across all tools, services, and API usage.

***

### How to Acquire CGPTc

CGPTc is acquired by **directly converting $CGPT tokens** within the ChainGPT application.

Upon entering the ChainGPT application suite, users connect their Web3 wallets. Once connected, the dashboard (top-right corner, near the account/address settings) displays your current CGPTc balance.

By clicking the balance display, a modal window will appear, prompting users to initiate a token exchange to convert $CGPT into CGPTc.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**\*Be advised:** *All $CGPT to CGPTc conversions are final. There is no way to undo or trade out of CGPTc back into $CGPT tokens. This is a one-way action.*&#x20;

# CGPTsp (Staking Points)

ChainGPT Token Staking Points

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FLfRWgsNtLPDyj1x3gCEM%2FXnip2025-02-06_11-21-06.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=fec00f6a-6463-445e-af46-eb020f9030f0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### What are CGPTsp?

CGPTsp stands for ChainGPT staking points, a weighted accounting system used to determine the degree of commitment a user has to the ChainGPT ecosystem based on the factors of their total amount of tokens staked and the duration of their stakes.

### What is the purpose of CGPTsp?

CGPTsp plays a vital role in creating a balanced socioeconomic environment that gives less capitalized actors an opportunity to have a greater impact on the overall ecosystem.&#x20;

The more CGPTsp an account is attributed with, the more governance power it will have, the higher the tier in the ChainGPT Pad it will unlock, and the greater its opportunities for yield are.

### CGPTsp Calculation

The algorithm for calculating CGPTsp has been kept maximally simple, leveraging just two parameters: the total number of tokens and the pool specifications to which it is committed.

> Total $CGPT tokens staked **\*** the pool multiplier = Staking Points

**Token Weight:**\
***One*** staked $CGPT token equals ***one*** staking point.

**Pool Multiplier Weight:**

Pool Multipliers are the weighted portion that is derived from the parameters of lockup durations and yield sizes; the longer the lockup, the higher the yield, the higher the multiplier.

**Pool Options:**\
ChainGPT offers a multitude of staking modules that each carry its own unique specifications and opportunities:

**45 days** = **1x** points multiplier | 1% APY\
**90 days** = **1.3x** points multiplier | 3% APY\
**180 days** = **1.5x** points multiplier | 5% APY\
**365 days** = **2x** points multiplier | 8% APY\
**365 days** = **2.5x** points multiplier | 0% APY

# CGPTvp (Voting Power)

#### **What is CGPTvp?**

CGPTvp stands for ChainGPT Voting Power. It is a metric used within the ChainGPT ecosystem to determine the influence and impact a user has when it comes to participating in the ChainGPT DAO Governance system.

***

#### **Relation to CGPTsp**

CGPTvp has a direct and linear relationship with CGPTsp. Simply put, 1 CGPTvp is equal to 1 CGPTsp. To understand the importance of CGPTvp, one must first grasp the significance of CGPTsp in the ChainGPT ecosystem. CGPTsp, or ChainGPT staking points, is a weighted accounting system that assesses a user's commitment to the ChainGPT ecosystem based on factors such as the number of tokens they have staked and the duration of their stakes.

***

#### **Why is CGPTvp Important?**

The importance of CGPTvp lies in its function as a voting metric. With the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and their governance structures, having a say in the direction and decisions of the platform is crucial. By tying voting power to CGPTsp, ChainGPT ensures that those who are more invested and committed to the platform have a proportionate say in its governance.

***

#### **How is CGPTvp Calculated?**

The calculation of CGPTvp is straightforward, as it derives its value from CGPTsp. If a user wishes to understand their CGPTvp, they can calculate their CGPTsp based on the total

* **.$CGPT tokens staked** (1 staked $CGPT token equals one staking point)
* **Pool Multiplier Weight** (This varies based on the lockup duration and the yield)

For example, staking in a pool with a 90-day duration would grant the user a 1.3x points multiplier.

***

#### **Use in ChainGPT DAO Governance**

CGPTvp is pivotal in the ChainGPT DAO Governance system. Users with a higher CGPTvp will naturally have more influence in votes, decisions, and proposals within the ChainGPT ecosystem. This ensures that decisions made within the DAO represent those deeply engaged with the platform.

# DAO Governance

ChainGPT's Decentralized Autonomous Organization

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FDme8gzqyyAj4KGmeRj1H%2F10.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9e900121-7277-4638-9159-85654ec6d079" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Visit ChainGPT's DAO:** [https://dao.chaingpt.org ](https://dao.chaingpt.org)

## Governance Introduction

The ChainGPT DAO is the vehicle for supporting decision-making regarding the development and direction of the project. It is the focal point for rallying the community around important decisions and coordinating member efforts to enable or deny any changes from taking place.

Every member of the ChainGPT DAO has the unique ability to contribute their thoughts and exert influence over how ChainGPT's products are built, what path they travel, and many other technical matters.

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FrljEtOINYUHQUolaAebR%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=0306dbaa-6d56-438f-9ea6-c3e6822f46b2" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**How to become a DAO Member:**

The user journey of Induction into the ChainGPT DAO starts when they accrue the $CGPT token.&#x20;

Becoming a DAO member has been made maximally accessible by introducing a 1-token threshold level. That means in order to become a member with a degree of influence on the platform; users are required to own and stake just a single $CGPT token.

* Obtain $CGPT tokens ([list of exchanges](https://chaingpt.org/#buy))
* Stake $CGPT on <https://app.chaingpt.org/staking>
* Join the ChainGPT DAO on <https://app.chaingpt.org/dao>

### ChainGPT DAO Fund Explained

Containing 9% of the total token supply (\~90,000,000 $CGPT), the ChainGPT DAO has a treasury dedicated for use by the community.&#x20;

Initially, the fund will be locked, but starting on October 10th, 2023, 90 million $CGPT tokens will gradually become available over 4.5 years, injected monthly.

This unlocking process follows a schedule of 0% at the Token Generation Event (TGE), a 6-month waiting period, and then 54 months of vesting. So, no tokens are allocated at the moment of its creation; after a six-month cliff, a monthly release will begin and last for 54 months (until all 90,000,000 $CGPT are in the possession of the DAO).

DAO members have full control over when, how, and for what these tokens will be used by participating in creating and voting on proposals. In tune with the vision of a decentralized future, there will not be any base limitations set up around their utilization, anything from setting up new staking pools, moving tokens to a different blockchain network, or distributing airdrops to qualified stakers; the possibilities are solely in the hands of the DAO members.&#x20;

*Learn more about CGPT token economics* [*(click here)*](/chaingpt-v1-docs/our-ecosystem/cgpt-utility-token)*.*

### Voting&#x20;

The ability to participate in the deliberations is a function made available to every ChainGPT DAO member. Regardless of the capital capabilities, voting is the base right given to all community members.&#x20;

In order to make sure voters adhere to quality decision-making processes rather than simply assuming, the voting mechanism has been purposely designed so that voting can only be submitted once per proposal, per account. Users cannot switch their voting decisions after they have already locked in an initial vote.

### Creating a Proposal

In order to create/submit a proposal to the DAO, members must satisfy the criteria to become classified as Diamond tier (accruing over 200,000 CGPTsp).

1. Visit the proposal creation page: <https://app.chaingpt.org/dao>.
2. Choose an informative title and a concise description that clearly communicates your proposal's objectives and desired outcomes.
3. Offer multiple options for DAO members to consider, ensuring a comprehensive approach to decision-making.
4. Once you have finalized the proposal, submit it and deploy it on-chain.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** *When a proposal is created, a snapshot is taken of all CGPT stakers and their voting power at that moment. If someone stakes more tokens later, it won't change their voting power for proposals that already exist, even if those proposals are still live.*
{% endhint %}

### Proposal Process

When a proposal is submitted, there's a 12-hour waiting period before DAO members can start voting. Typically, proposals should be formatted within a 3-day/72-hour expiration period; however, in the event of more complex or impactful proposals, time horizons may be extended as needed.&#x20;

### Proposal Conclusions

The option that garners the largest percentage of support from the members will be implemented.

Implementations may not always be immediate, so during proposal considerations, the variable time horizons must be mentioned.

# Introduction & Overview

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64354b8ce4872a52ac1c7b06/648482523422cd6b71fa9094_ChainGPT.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### What is CGPT Pad?

The ChainGPT Pad is a Launchpad and IDO platform for Web3 projects that are looking to bring their ideas into the public domain and bootstrap their token ecosystems.

### How does it work?

As a launchpad, ChainGPT Pad services two sides of the market: the "consumers {participants}" and the "producers {projects}.

Projects apply to the ChainGPT Pad by going through a rigorous qualitative analysis process conducted by the ChainGPT team. Depending on these projects' level of sophistication and ability to satisfy a diverse range of assessment criteria (such as product-market fit, concept viability, team aptitude, and so on), their inclusion will be deduced.

If a project does not meet the threshold, it will not be allowed to list on ChainGPT Pad.

Induction into the launchpad has two paths, either through a direct listing or through the incubation/acceleration program.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Projects are not required to be part of the incubator/accelerator program. The IDO platform is open to any projects that satisfy the qualitative evaluations.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Direct listings mean that projects do not participate in the incubation/acceleration programs and are exclusively listing to host an IDO directly to the $CGPT community.
{% endhint %}

Projects that follow the incubation/acceleration process, where the teams are guided by the[ ChainGPT Mentorship](https://labs.chaingpt.org/) program, followed by a coming-to-market via IDO, will receive a multitude of benefits, including co-marketing and community cross-pollination.

Incubation can range anywhere from 6-8 months and includes a preparation stage, a launching stage, and a post-launch support stage. During preparation, the mentor group organizes the internal process, optimizes product systems, and helps projects evaluate their roadmaps/action plans. During the launch (whenever the IDO is being held), they help with promotions and social coordination. Post-launch, ChainGPT provides advisory support to help project course-correct and deal with the nuances that come with having products live on the market.

Acceleration is a condensed version of the incubation that is executed within 3‚Äì4 months. This option is best suited for well-developed teams that need a very specific, limited scope of support.

### How does the IDO work?

Whenever projects are ready to list on the platform and launch their token ecosystems, ChainGPT will help them prepare a campaign and connect them to the $CGPT community. After the specifications have been finalized, token supply, market rate, sale duration, etc. the project will be listed with a countdown to open.

Every IDO listing consists of 2 Rounds:

**- Round #1 (Preorder Round)**

Only Diamond Tier members can access this round.&#x20;

**- Round #2 (Guaranteed Allocation)**

All staking tier groups ‚Äî Bronze, Silver, Gold and Diamond Tier.  All users must register interest to participate in the Guaranteed Round.

**- Round #3 (FCFS)**

First Come First Serve ‚Äî All Tier Members need to have registered interest so they can participate in the FCFS round.

In the event that a project meets its maximum IDO capacity at any point, the IDO shall immediately cease and future round will not be engaged.

### What role does $CGPT play?

$CGPT acts as the tool to facilitate community involvement in the bootstrapping of projects, an extra layer of a reward system for incentivizing membership. Providing alpha access to IDO participation, Airdrops, and more, $CGPT community members that stake the threshold amounts of $CGPT tokens become able to obtain exclusive benefits that startup projects provide to their earliest contributors.

### How to Participate:

In order to participate in the IDOs hosted on ChainGPT Pad, users are required to satisfy two simple criteria:

***1)*** Complete KYC with our partners, Blockpass: [***KYC Here.*** ](http://url.chaingpt.org/kyc)\
\&#xNAN;***2)*** Stake $CGPT to accumulate enough points and attain a tier status: [***Stake Here***](https://pad.chaingpt.org/#/staking-pools)***.***

### Restricted countries

To view our most up-to-date list of restricted countries, please visit <https://docs.chaingpt.org/our-ecosystem/chaingpt-pad/faq#what-countries-are-restricted-from-idos>

NOTE: While IDO participation may be restricted, all other AI tools and services remain fully accessible to staked users.

{% hint style="warning" %}
KYC must be passed in order to participate.

# IDO Rounds Explained

Participation Rounds for Initial Dex Offerings on ChainGPT

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FtK8JAUABp1hoLWDc8qZn%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f49bbb9e-839a-46a2-8be3-e17489018ddb" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## ChainGPT Pad IDO Launch Process

ChainGPT Pad employs a two-phased approach to IDO launches, designed to encourage commitment from the CGPT user base and maximize opportunities for projects to complete their sales.\
\
**Pre-Order Access (Diamond Tier Only)**

Pre-Order access is exclusive to Diamond Tier members, providing additional time to participate in the IDO before the general Guaranteed Round opens.

‚Ä¢ Duration: 12 hours.

‚Ä¢ Access: Diamond Tier members only.

‚Ä¢ Purpose: Allows top-tier members early access to the IDO.\\

**Round #1 (Guaranteed Allocation)**

The first round is reserved for Silver, Gold, and Diamond Tier members who register their interest prior to the IDO launch. Registration typically opens a week before and closes 24 hours before the launch.

‚Ä¢ Duration: A minimum of 24 hours.

‚Ä¢ Eligibility: Silver, Gold, and Diamond Tier members, with a limited number of Bronze Tier members earning access through social campaigns.

‚Ä¢ Conditions: The round may end early if 99% of the total capacity is reached.\\

**Round #2 (FCFS - First Come First Serve)**

The second round operates on a First Come, First Serve basis and is open to the broader ChainGPT community. No prior registration is needed, but participants should be aware that the sale could close early if the full capacity is reached.

‚Ä¢ Duration: 12 hours (unless otherwise specified).

‚Ä¢ Eligibility: Open to all KYC-compliant members.

‚Ä¢ Condition: A minimum of 1% of the total capacity is reserved for this round, ensuring broader participation.


# Staking

#### **Staking & Points System:**

The staking system for becoming a Launchpad-qualified member is based on a straightforward point system. Two factors come into the accounting of points: the token amount staked and the duration of the stake. Combining the two will place members into one of the four possible tier categories: Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond.

***1 $CGPT is equal to 1 point***\
\
Each staking pool duration will bring its own point multiplier:\\

* 3-Years Staking Pool (3x)
* (2nd) 3-Years Staking Pool (3x)
* 2-Years Staking Pool (2.5x)
* 1-Year Staking Pool (2.2x)
* 180-Days Staking Pool (1.7x)
* 90-Days Staking Pool (1.4x)
* 45-Days Staking Pool (1.1x)
* 365-Days Staking Pool (2x)
* 180-Days Staking Pool (1.5x)
* 90-Days Staking Pool (1.3x)
* 45-Days Staking Pool (1x)

Our Staking Pools are on BNB Chain. Visit the ChainGPT Pad staking page [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pad.chaingpt.org/staking-pools\&sa=D\&source=docs\&ust=1755551826977823\&usg=AOvVaw2KRLxRAZqcVVcN0RjksQsP).

# Tier System

The Tier system of ChainGPT Pad

To maintain maximal fairness among all users, ChainGPT employs a simple four-tier system for the ChainGPT Pad. This is the same tier model applicable to the general ecosystem, which can be found here: [<mark style="color:blue;">**Link to tier System & Benefits.**</mark> ](https://www.chaingpt.org/blog/chaingpt-launchpad-tier-system-staking)

As with earlier (non-bronze) levels, members of the Diamond tier receive access to both IDO rounds. Likewise with the preceding Gold Tier, one of the most appealing drivers for Diamond tier members is the unlocked IDO allocation claims. For every IDO launched on ChainGPT Pad, a portion of the tokens collected will be distributed among Gold & Diamond tier members. Of course, the proportional allocation is more significant for higher-tier members.

Diamond tier members also receive additional incentives from the ChainGPT partnership network through priority NFT distributions and private token allocations.

The Diamond Tier is the only one that pushes the benefits beyond the realm of the ChainGPT Pad and into other vectors of ChainGPT's ecosystem, namely Freemium tools and DAO proposal rights.&#x20;

Here, members are automatically granted unlimited access to all ChainGPT AI tools and receive monthly CGPTc balance refills of up to 20,000 credits. Thereby incentivizing membership at his level with ecosystemic participation in every possible manner.

Diamond Tier members also happen to be the only group of community members who are endowed with the ability to submit proposals. While any $CGPT token holder is allowed to participate in steering the outcomes of decisions, only Diamond Tier members can push the suggestions for community deliberations.

### Point System:

*The Point system is a method of calculating the impact a user‚Äôs stake has on their participation.*

Points within the tier system act as a mechanism to track the degree of a user‚Äôs commitment/reputation within the ChainGPT ecosystem and attribute accurate amplification weights to the staking user‚Äôs allocation rights.

In an attempt to retain maximal simplicity and efficiency, points are calculated by taking the amount of tokens staked and multiplying them by the stake pool

*Total $CGPT tokens staked **\*** the pool multiplier = Tier Points*

***1 staked $CGPT = 1 tier point***

If a user stakes ***1,000 $CGPT*** into a ***45-day pool***, they have ***1,000 Tier points***\
If a user stakes ***1,000 $CGPT*** into a ***90-day pool***, they have ***1,300 Tier points***\
If a user stakes ***1,000 $CGPT*** into a ***180-day pool***, they have ***1,500 Tier points***\
If a user stakes ***1,000 $CGPT*** into a ***365-day pool***, they have ***2,000 Tier points***

***

### **Tier Allocation Multiplier**

Allocation multipliers are the parameter that dictates the absolute size of a user's allocation relative to the total token allocation (as measured by the base 1x multiplier available for bronze tier members).

***Bronze Tier*** multiplier is fixed at ***1x*** for all participants, regardless of whether they have 2,000 points or 10,000 points.

However, in the upper three tiers of Silver, Gold, and Diamond, multipliers are scaled proportionately within their according tier ranges according to the size of the stake/amount of points and the relative positioning of those points leading up to the next tier.

**Examples of two people in ü•à Silver tier:**

Bobby has exactly ***20,000 points*** from staking; his multiplier is ***4x.***\
Sally has ***35,000 points*** from staking; her multiplier is ***7x***.

Examples of two people in ü•áGold tier:

Robert has exactly ***50,000 points*** from staking; his multiplier is ***10x***.\
Georgette has ***100,000*** points from staking; her multiplier is ***20x***.

Examples of two people in üíé Diamond tier:

Garry has exactly ***200,000 points*** from staking; his multiplier is ***40x***.\
Elizabeth has ***400,000*** points from staking; her multiplier might be ***50x***.

*Due to the theoretically limitless capacity of a Diamond Tier staker, the multiplier is correlated logarithmically based on the final outcome of each IDO.*

{% hint style="info" %}
A minimal bronze-tier level is required in order to be admitted to the launchpad IDOs.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Every tier is capable of requesting a refund, and the refunds are 100% of the allocated capital.

# Buzz System Explained

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FkGh6YPPj4z42vDZlTquI%2Ftelegram-cloud-photo-size-5-6118228364406933787-y.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=3600b372-20af-4992-8f2e-783ae286c45d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Buzz System is ChainGPT Pad‚Äôs next-gen launch engine, built to create virality, momentum, and real adoption before a token even hits the market.

***

### TL;DR ‚Äì Why Buzz Matters

Most token launches rely on one-off airdrops or IDOs that spark short-term hype but fade fast.

Buzz changes that by gamifying social engagement to build sustained, viral momentum before launch.

* **For Projects:** Trend on X, boost sentiment, dominate rankings, and grow a real community before TGE.
* **For Users:** Earn free tokens or allocation by helping a project go viral.
* **For the ChainGPT Ecosystem:** Higher-quality launches, stronger communities, and constant exposure for ChainGPT.

***

### 1) Why This Matters

The Web3 launch market has proven: projects that go viral early win mindshare, adoption, and staying power. Buzz systematizes virality while rewarding quality over quantity.

**What projects get with Buzz:**

* High-quality KOLs, founders, and credible crypto accounts talking about the project.
* Attraction of whales and high-net-worth participants.
* Onboarding of real product users, not just followers.
* Growth in token holders with quality profiles.
* Viral exposure on Crypto Twitter (X) and across social.
* A larger, more engaged community.
* Positive sentiment and momentum before, during, and after TGE.

***

### 2) What is the Buzz System?

### 7) Points System (How Your Posts Earn Points)

Buzz Points are earned by creating quality posts on X (Twitter) that follow campaign rules. The system rewards authenticity, reach, and quality, not spam.

#### How you earn points:

* Required Tags: Every post must include the project‚Äôs hashtag (#ProjectName) and token ticker ($TOKEN). Missing either = no points.
* **Extra Mentions:** Tagging the project account, ChainGPT, or adding the campaign link gives you bonus points.
* **Media:** Posts with images or videos earn extra points.
* **Followers:** Accounts with genuine, high-quality ‚ÄúSmart Followers‚Äù earn higher multipliers. Verified followers also help, but quality > quantity.
* **Content Quality:** AI reviews each post. Spammy or copy-pasted content earns nothing. Generic/AI-generated posts earn less. Original, engaging content can earn up to 2√ó more points.
* **Account Age:** Older, trusted accounts score higher. New or botted accounts may earn little or nothing.
* **Staking Boost:** Staking $CGPT increases your multiplier and helps you climb the leaderboard faster. Staking is optional, but gives you an edge. If you don‚Äôt stake, your score stays neutral (1√ó multiplier), doesn't get an additional boost.

#### Content Quality Scoring (AI-Reviewed):

* 0.00√ó ‚Äî Spam (mentions 5+ tokens/projects, or obvious farming)
* 0.25√ó ‚Äî Poor (irrelevant, very low effort)
* 0.50√ó ‚Äî AI-Generated (generic, robotic, or Buzz button posts)
* 1.00√ó ‚Äî Neutral (acceptable but not insightful)
* 1.50√ó ‚Äî Good (relevant, thoughtful, adds value)
* 2.00√ó ‚Äî Excellent (original, insightful, highly engaging)

{% hint style="info" %}
**üëâ Note:** You get no points for spam content, decreased points for poor/AI-generated content, neutral (1√ó) for okay content, good posts earn a 50% boost (1.5√ó), and excellent posts get double points (2√ó).
{% endhint %}

#### Limits & Fairness Controls:

* Max 1 rewarded post every 8 hours per project.
* No user can earn more than 10% of the buzzer pool, even if they dominate chatter.
* Deleted, private, or duplicate posts don‚Äôt count.
* Leaderboard updates every 5‚Äì10 minutes ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry if scores don‚Äôt appear instantly.
* Spam, bots, and fake accounts are disqualified. Only real users earn rewards.

{% hint style="info" %}
**‚ö° Pro Tips:**

* One great post beats 10 low-effort ones.
* Use images or videos for extra reach.
* Grow genuine followers ‚Äî fake followers won‚Äôt help.
* Register before snapshot, otherwise your points won‚Äôt count.
* üî• Buzz button tweets are convenient, but they count as AI-generated (lower score). Write in your own words for maximum rewards.

# ChainGPT Pad Giveaways and Launchdrops: Technical Overview

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2F0VwqEQoETEfcpnkGLboR%2FLaunchdrops%20and%20Giveaways%20Documentation%20Page.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=3cdc12b6-f1eb-4fc8-ac08-5009e25b5490" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

ChainGPT Pad provides multiple avenues for users to participate in token distributions through its Giveaways and Launchdrops. These initiatives are designed to reward active community members and investors while also fostering engagement with emerging Web3 projects.

Both Giveaways and Launchdrops provide value by allowing users to receive tokens without requiring additional investments beyond their existing participation in the ChainGPT Pad ecosystem.&#x20;

This document outlines the mechanisms, eligibility requirements, and distinctions between these two distribution models to help users understand how they can take full advantage of these opportunities.

### Giveaways on ChainGPT Pad

Giveaways are exclusive reward distributions for participants of projects that have conducted an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on ChainGPT Pad or DegenPad.&#x20;

These giveaways serve as an additional benefit for investors who support projects through IDOs and choose not to refund their contributions.

#### Eligibility Criteria

* Users must have participated in the corresponding IDO.
* Refund requests disqualify users from the giveaway.
* Allocation is based on the [user's tier](https://www.chaingpt.org/blog/chaingpt-launchpad-tier-system-staking?_gl=1*14zivz4*_gcl_au*MTIxNjYzNTMyLjE3MzYzMzA2ODk.) within the ChainGPT Pad [staking system](https://www.chaingpt.org/blog/chaingpt-launchpad-tier-system-staking?_gl=1*1vqngeb*_gcl_au*MTIxNjYzNTMyLjE3MzYzMzA2ODk.).

#### Giveaway Process

1. Participation: Users eligible for the giveaway must confirm their participation by registering during the period of the registration round.
2. Allocation Calculation: Token distribution follows the same tier-based approach as IDOs.
3. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Mechanism: Unclaimed tokens at the end of the giveaway period are reallocated among eligible participants, potentially increasing their final allocation.
4. Claiming Tokens: Once finalized, users can claim their allocated tokens through their ChainGPT Pad dashboard. Note that a vesting schedule with linear distribution applies, which may vary from one project to another.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdFiPDw48jN-ypLDRj3ZBepSW5a7FYVHAk3NqR76Dw7yWAObwL9m3CxMoF-MHnYH3few6JYDvQOSKyiAlhr60tOb9ZEDONXlMRCNE9W4PrBtyzjpKVZTY7n_BVG_fhEZmrwExZ8?key=7UFN63x0b5hju3hsNy-GSiz1" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Notable Giveaways

One of the largest giveaways on ChainGPT Pad was for [Solidus AI Tech](https://pad.chaingpt.org/pools/150000-aitech-giveaway-free-tokens?completed=true), which offered significant rewards and a high return on investment (ROI).

In addition to standard giveaways, special Incubation Giveaways are organized to celebrate ChainGPT Pad's incubation projects with the community. These giveaways, which often last for a month or more, reward participants with both project tokens and CGPT.&#x20;

Examples of incubation and acceleration giveaways include:

* [Kima](https://pad.chaingpt.org/pools/400000-in-kima-free-token-giveaway-228?completed=true)
* [Cookie3](https://pad.chaingpt.org/pools/240000-in-cookie-free-token-giveaway?completed=true)

Showcasing ChainGPT Pad's commitment to supporting its incubation projects and engaging its community in meaningful ways.

### Launchdrops: A New Path to Token Rewards

Launchdrops are a recent addition to ChainGPT Pad, allowing members to receive free token distributions without participating in an IDO. These distributions are conducted in collaboration with innovative Web3 projects that did not conduct an IDO on ChainGPT Pad but still wish to engage with the community.

#### Eligibility Criteria

* Users must be KYC-verified on ChainGPT Pad.
* Users must have a staked CGPT tier to qualify for allocations.
* Allocation is based on staking points and multipliers, similar to the IDO allocation system.

#### Launchdrop Process

1. Verification: Ensure KYC is completed and wallet is connected.
2. Tier-Based Allocation: Staking in different pools affects the allocation, with higher tiers receiving larger distributions.
3. Token Distribution: Eligible users automatically receive their tokens once the Launchdrop is finalized.
4. Claiming Tokens: Once finalized, users can claim their allocated tokens through their ChainGPT Pad dashboard. Note that a vesting schedule with linear distribution applies, which may vary from one project to another.

#### Key Benefits of Launchdrops

* No prior IDO participation required.
* Exclusive for ChainGPT Pad members with a staked tier.
* Supports promising Web3 projects beyond the IDO framework.

### Key Differences Between Giveaways and Launchdrops

| Feature                   | Giveaways                                                  | Launchdrops                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eligibility               | Requires IDO participation                                 | Requires KYC and CGPT staking                               |
| Allocation Basis          | IDO tier-based allocation                                  | Staking tier-based allocation                               |
| Refund Impact             | Refund disqualifies eligibility                            | Not applicable                                              |
| Token Source              | Projects that conducted IDOs on ChainGPT Pad and DegenPad. | External projects not launching via ChainGPT Pad            |
| Participation Requirement | Active opt-in post-IDO                                     | You must choose to opt-in to Launchdrops through signing up |

# Flexible Refund Policy

ChainGPT Initial DEX Offering Refund System

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64354b8ce4872a52ac1c7b06/648cd2afa08b27df921caac4_Refund%20Policy.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

*ChainGPT‚Äôs launchpad has been designed from the ground up with maximum security considerations on behalf of the users. As a mechanism to mitigate risks, protect against malicious activity, and align the behaviors of projects that get listed on the Launchpad, a novel refund policy has been implemented.*

### **How The Refund Policy Works**

Immediately following the successful completion of an IDO, a grace period begins.

Grace periods will last anywhere from 1-7 days, as deemed necessary according to the risk evaluations conducted by ChainGPT Pad's administrative team. Under certain circumstances, this period may vary; if the grace period is outside of this range, clear communications about it shall be made available across all community social media channels.

For the duration of the grace period, Launchpad users/IDO participants will be presented with two options in their dashboard: **‚Äú*****Claim*****‚Äù** and **‚Äú*****Refund*****‚Äù**.&#x20;

During any point within the grace period, users have the right to evaluate the market performance and inspect the team's intentions under greater scrutiny. Should any concerns (or personal circumstances) arise where the user no longer wants to participate in the token launch, they can withdraw from participation by simply selecting ‚Äú**Refund**.‚Äù Once clicked, a new ‚Äú**Claim** **Refund**‚Äù button will appear. You need to click there in order to get your refund. Please note, refunds are not airdropped automatically into your wallet

Be advised the inverse logic holds true for the ***"Claim"** option*. If at any point a user selects **‚Äú*****Claim*****‚Äù** they will secure their tokens and begin collecting their token allocations (via the predefined vesting schedule); which would result in the voiding of the refund option completely.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
*Participation confirmations are FINAL.*&#x20;

Once claimed, refunds are voided. \
Once refunded, claims are voided.
{% endhint %}

### **Refund Qualification**

Refunds are 100% recouped; there are no penalties for using it.&#x20;

Every tier/grade of participant, from bronze all the way up to diamond, qualifies for a refund on their committed funds, so long as they make their request within the allotted refund period time frame and do not claim before its expiry.

### Restricted Countries

To view our most up-to-date list of restricted countries, please visit <https://docs.chaingpt.org/our-ecosystem/chaingpt-pad/faq#what-countries-are-restricted-from-idos>

### **Conclusion**

The presence of a Refund policy is intended to provide protection to both sides of the market's participants and uphold the high-quality standards and platform features of ChainGPT Pad.&#x20;

First and foremost, the refunds protect the $CGPT community, minimizing (if not neutralizing) any malicious intents from IDO projects. At the same time, the added time pressures incentivize higher degrees of behavioral alignment for the projects. Moreover, these extended parameters act as metaphoric guard rails that deter lower-quality projects from even attempting to infiltrate the ChainGPT ecosystem.

{% hint style="info" %}
Every IDO on the ChainGPT Launchpad has a qualitative assessment take place prior to listing that will, as part of its results, determine a ‚Äúrefund grace period‚Äù.&#x20;

> ***A quick guide to understanding the claiming and refunding process post IDO.***

After an IDO on the ChainGPT Pad is completed, a cooldown period lasts until the TGE. As soon as the TGE begins, the cooldown is over, and users will have two options unlocked in their dashboards:

**Option #1:** Claim Tokens\
**Option #2:** Request a Refund

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64354b8ce4872a52ac1c7b06/64bdb0a279e0f267cc2034a9_Claim%20or%20refund.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>CLAIM OR REFUND OPTIONS BECOME AVAILABLE</em></p></figcaption></figure>

### Claiming

As soon as you select ‚ÄúClaim Tokens‚Äù, the dashboard will show a green checkmark on the right-hand side under the ‚ÄúSchedule‚Äù section. Once the checkmark appears, the refund option on the bottom will show a red cross and state, "you have already claimed TOKEN; you are not eligible to request a refund.

*üí° **Reminder:** By claiming tokens, you will forgo the ability to refund your allocation.*

### Refund

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64354b8ce4872a52ac1c7b06/64bdb0d2ba579d6cce4081f6_Refund%20requested.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>REFUND REQUESTED FROM CHAINGPT PAD IDO</em></p></figcaption></figure>

If you select the ‚ÄúRequest Refund‚Äù option in the bottom section, the dashboard will immediately remove your alternative ‚ÄúClaim‚Äù option and confirm that your refund has been submitted.

Submitted requests will provide the status of ‚ÄúRefund Requested‚Äù in yellow characters in the refund section, as well as the time of the request and the approximate time the refund will become available.

*üí° **Reminder:** Refund requests require a processing time of up to 24 hours after initiation.*

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64354b8ce4872a52ac1c7b06/64bdb0eeb703f9575b6b222a_Refund%20successful.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>IDO REFUND REQUEST SUCCESSFUL</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Once the request is processed, you must return to the IDO page and verify that it has been processed.

As soon as the Refund section at the lower portion of the dashboard changes to green text by the status, you will collect your funds into the wallet you used to participate.

# Delegate Staking Functionality

Delegate Staking on ChainGPT Pad

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FGUE1F0GaGZy1Nm4zrNNp%2FScreenshot%202025-03-20%2016.49.25.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2518a6e8-170a-4f1a-bb2c-b8579e78c94e" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Delegate Staking allows users to give their staking points to others and to share their staking points to their other wallets.&#x20;

This means a user can assign (delegate) their points to another user, who can then use them for other functionalities of the application. With the staking points they receive, they can achieve a tier level, which grants them allocations for IDO pools, participation in pools, and access to other features.&#x20;

Sharing points across multiple wallets of their own also allows them to engage in the ChainGPT ecosystem with more ease. And also adds an added layer of security.

Additionally, users have the ability to take back (revoke) the points they previously delegated or remove (delete) them entirely.

## Staking Balance & Delegation Summary

Before delegating staking points, users will see a staking summary panel displaying their current staking balance and delegation status. Below is a breakdown of the key metrics shown:

* Total Staking Points: Displays the total staking points a user owns.
* Points Available to Delegate: Shows the number of staking points that can still be delegated.
* Total Staking Points Delegated: Represents the total amount of staking points the user has already delegated.
* Staking Points from Delegation: Indicates the number of staking points received from other users via delegation.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXesJ5ztgBGOLKZpQJ7WufX5yBWNtk1y10XCeeK-WkBBulzebgRS7z8pG-wgL6aFKQvh3P0bQx_YIQRo04tYaIpstmkif6_zlDSkWisO3MB_5VhXnSjNODXTyi5-o5_XP6M-S5hdJQ?key=EnS-6xtZMtwe-L-yEeVDWuZl" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Features

1. ### Delegate Staking Points

The original owner retains control and can revoke or delete the delegation at any time.

#### To delegate staking points, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the Staking Pools Page: Open the application and go to the Staking Pools page.

2. ### Revoke Delegated Staking Points

Revocation allows users to take back staking points that they previously delegated to another user. This feature gives flexibility by letting users reclaim their points if needed. When a user revokes staking points, those points are removed from the recipient's balance and returned to the original user.

#### To revoke staking points, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the Staking Pools Page: Open the application and go to the Staking Pools page.

3. ### Remove Delegated Staking Points

Deletion allows users to permanently remove staking points they have previously delegated. Unlike revocation, where points are returned to the original user's balance, deletion completely erases the delegation record. This can be useful if the user wants to remove old or unnecessary delegations.

#### To delete delegated staking points, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the Staking Pools Page: Open the application and go to the Staking Pools page.

## Important Points

* Tier Changes with Staking Points: When a user receives staking points from another user, their tier level changes accordingly. Similarly, if the original owner revokes the delegated staking points, the recipient‚Äôs tier will be adjusted again.
* Restriction on Delegated Points Redistribution: A user cannot delegate staking points that they have received through delegation from another user. Delegation is only allowed from the original staking points owned by the user.
* Delegation Impact on Degenpad: If you delegate staking points to another wallet, 50% of your staking points will be deducted from DegenPad. Similarly, the recipient who receives the staking points will gain 50% staking points on DegenPad.
* Delegation Restrictions for Active IDO Pools:
* A user cannot delegate staking points if they or the recipient have already participated in an active IDO pool.
* Similarly, the user cannot revoke or delete delegated points if the recipient is still part of an active IDO pool.
* If a user tries to delegate, revoke, or delete staking points while they or the recipient have already participated in an active IDO pool, they will receive an error message.

* Definition of Active IDO Pool: An IDO pool is considered active if:
* The swap time has started, but the swap has not yet ended.
* The pool is not yet filled.
* If the pool is filled or ended, it is no longer considered active.

# One Wallet Connect - Unified Wallet Integration Guide (EVM & Solana)

Get started with connecting your wallet to ChainGPT Pad!

## Overview

Our unified wallet integration significantly simplifies and enhances user accessibility to Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) across multiple blockchain networks, including Solana and various EVM-compatible chains.&#x20;

This integration addresses common user pain points by eliminating the need to manage multiple wallets simultaneously. Now, users can independently connect their Solana or EVM wallet based on the pool they're interacting with.

The biggest improvement is with Solana: users no longer need to have both wallets connected. Once a Solana wallet is linked to an EVM wallet via the user profile, users can fully interact with Solana pools using only their Solana wallet.

Below, you can find the necessary steps to get started on [ChainGPT Pad](https://app.gitbook.com/u/vt7ouO7Toga7R4fjv601TLYsQCx2) with Solana.

**Please note**: If you don‚Äôt have a ChainGPT account, please set one up and return to this guide.

### Step 1 - Connect your wallet

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2F7cWOhFcuKQ9r06INiQgM%2FPad%20FAQs.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=ff0c4a31-fdb8-46f3-a8dc-961aa48f3686" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## General

<details>

<summary>What is the ChainGPT Pad?</summary>

It is a platform for incubating promising projects that are looking to introduce a token into their ecosystems and launch them via IDOs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is an IDO?</summary>

IDO stands for Initial DEX Offering. It is a public fundraising method that pools retail users' capital by utilizing a decentralized platform to facilitate transactions.

This model is superior to the preceding ICO model because the platform can provide a higher degree of security for end users by collecting the funding and only releasing the projects after the satisfaction of specific criteria.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is Crowdfunding / Private Sales?</summary>

The crowdfunding/private sale is a very early round of fundraising that takes place right before an IDO.

Typically, just a day or so before an IDO launch. These rounds tend to offer superior rates but also incur prolonged vesting periods.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is FCFS?</summary>

FCFS is the acronym for First-Come-First-Serve, and it refers to the round of fundraising that becomes available to the general public after the guaranteed round.

As the name might suggest, FCFS rounds are based on timing; available token supplies are sold to participants who arrive ahead of others.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the Incubation Program?</summary>

Providing support, guidance, and accelerating excellence, the ChainGPT Incubation is an extensive, in-depth, multi-month-long program of intense, intimate collaboration between promising projects that are looking to launch into Web3.

</details>

## IDO and Allocation Policy

<details>

<summary>Can I participate in IDOs right after purchasing $CGPT?</summary>

Almost. Before being able to participate in the IDOs, users must do two more actions.\
\
First, once $CGPT is acquired, users must make sure to have enough tier points for inclusion; if yes, then simply staking their tokens in the official [Staking Dashboard](https://pad.chaingpt.org/staking-pools).\
\
Second, they must pass KYC <http://url.chaingpt.org/kyc>.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there a refund policy?</summary>

Yes. Every IDO launch will have a ‚Äúrefund grace period‚Äù of 7‚Äì14 days, allowing participating users added time to evaluate their decisions before finalizing the commitments.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I have to KYC in order to access the Launchpad?</summary>

Yes. KYC is required for participating at any tier level. The KYC process has been made maximally simple through our partner, Blockpass. To sign up, please follow our official link: <http://url.chaingpt.org/kyc>.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is pool weight calculated?</summary>

Pool weight is calculated based on the distribution of tier points among participating members and their corresponding tier levels.

Every pool has a structured base range that is dependent on their staking tier points.

Bronze | 1x | 2,000 points ‚Äî 19,999 points Silver | 4x ‚Äî 9.99x | 20,000 points ‚Äî 49,999 points Gold | 10x ‚Äî 39.99x | 50,000 points ‚Äî 199,999 points Diamond | 40x + | 200,000 points +

The pool weight indicates how much multiplier is applied to that specific tier level‚Äôs allocation capacity.

Bronze maintains a base level of 1x multiplier throughout its entire point range. The Silver, Gold, and Diamond levels pool weights are scaled proportionally to the individual stakers point position within its range. To best understand the mechanism is through an empirical example:

In the event of a Silver tier with 20,000 points, they have a 4x multiplier. In the event of a Silver tier with 35,000 points, they have a 7x multiplier. In the event of a Silver tier with 49,999 points, they have a 9.99x multiplier.

This logic applies to the Gold tier equally.

Given that Diamond level can theoretically have no point limit, the cap on the multiplier for them is logarithmically relational to the total IDO‚Äôs upper bound.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What crypto tokens can be used to participate in IDOs?</summary>

Stablecoins: USDT, USDC, BUSD\
Cryptocurrencies: BNB, ETH

</details>

<details>

<summary>What countries are restricted from using ChainGPT Pad?</summary>

**For IDOs, IBOs, and Launchdrops:**&#x20;

* Persons from the United States and Canada cannot participate in any IDO due to the lack of clear regulations in the crypto space.

- Countries restricted or sanctioned include: Afghanistan, Algeria, American Samoa, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Botswana, Canada, Central African Republic, China, Cuba, Egypt, Guam, Hong Kong, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Morocco, Nepal, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Yemen.

* For users in other regions where regulations remain unclear, participation will be evaluated on a project-by-project basis.

**For Buzzdrops:**&#x20;

* Countries restricted or sanctioned include: Algeria, Bangladesh, Canada, China, Cuba, Egypt, Hong Kong, Iran, Iraq, Monaco, Nepal, North Korea, Syria, Tunisia, United Kingdom, United States, Ukraine (Fully Embargoed Regions) - Crimea, Donetsk (DNR), Luhansk (LNR)

</details>

### Tiers and Staking

<details>

<summary>Can I stake into multiple Pools and still acquire points?</summary>

Yes. If you wish to split up your $CGPT stake across different pools, the launchpad will calculate your points based on their individual placements.

For example, if you stake 2,500 $CGPT into the 45-day pool for 2,500 points and 2,500 $CGPT into the 180-day pool for 3,750 points, your associated wallet will be attributed the aggregated 6,250 tier points.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are tier points calculated?</summary>

Tier points are calculated based on two simple factors: the number of tokens staked and the duration of the staking pool to which they are allocated.

1 $CGPT = 1 point

45 days.  = 1:1 point

90 days = 1:1.3 points,&#x20;

180 days = 1:1.5 points

365 days = 1:2 points

Example: 1,000 $CGPT in the 180-day pool would yield 1,500 points.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How many different tiers are there?</summary>

There are four tiers in the launchpad system: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. To understand how tier levels are calculated, please refer to our dedicated post: [ChainGPT Launch Pad ‚Äî Tier System & Staking](https://medium.com/chaingpt-blog/chaingpt-launch-pad-tier-system-staking-364d2a63a10e).

</details>

<details>

<summary>What does Allocation Multiplier mean?</summary>

The allocation multiplier specifies the amount of tokens that participants can purchase at the different tier levels. Every tier has its own corresponding allocation multiplier: Bronze: 1, Silver: 4+, Gold: 10+, Diamond 40+.

</details>

## For Projects

<details>

<summary>Can any category of project apply for listing?</summary>

Yes, absolutely!\
\
Innovators from all sectors of the digital economy are invited to apply.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there a criteria that must be met in order to list?</summary>

Yes. ChainGPT upholds high-quality standards that must be met in order for a project to be given access to the LaunchPad.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the onboarding process for applying?</summary>

After submitting an application, they will undergo an initial screening by the ChainGPT Team. Following the screening, projects will be put through an in-depth due-diligence process. Only projects that pass the rigorous qualitative assessment are inducted into the incubator and allowed to list their IDOs on the Launchpad.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the incubation program?</summary>

The incubation program is a system to support the early stages of a project's development and bootstrap its operations prior to launching the product.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How long is the Incubation Program?</summary>

The incubation program's duration depends on the project's individual needs, averaging around 12 months but can be as long as 18‚Äì24 months.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is Incubation necessary or can we just apply for IDO?</summary>

Projects are not required to be incubated to apply for an IDO listing. However, if a project decides to go through the incubation program, then it must IDO via the ChainGPT Pad.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the max cap on what projects can raise during IDO?</summary>

There is no set maximum. The capacity is based on a project-to-project basis. Many factors will be considered, which help gauge potential outcomes whenever the fundraising goals are being set, which will dictate the maximum capacity.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Which blockchains are available to launch an IDO on?</summary>

Here are the blockchains currently available to host your IDO on through ChainGPT Pad:\
\
\- Ethereum\
\- Polygon\
\- Solana\

# Register Interest

Signaling Intentions to participate in ChainGPT Pad IDOs

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64354b8ce4872a52ac1c7b06/64aee481d1bc2ea3b2213dd5_Register%20Interest.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The IDO process for participants of the ChainGPT Pad consists of two rounds: a Guaranteed round and an FCFS round.

Available exclusively to the top three tier levels (Silver, Gold, and Diamond) that have accumulated enough CGPTsp by staking $CGPT tokens, being able to secure a position in the guaranteed round is only available to those members who indicate their desire to participate by signaling their intentions through the ‚ÄúRegister Interest‚Äù function that can be seen on every listing in the ‚ÄúUpcoming‚Äù section.

Before users can activate this right and unlock this function, they must complete the two preliminary entry steps:

**1)** Pass the KYC process with our partner, Blockpass. \
\&#xNAN;*Submit here* [***ChainGPT Pad KYC***](http://url.chaingpt.org/kyc)***.*** \
\
**2)** Stake $CGPT tokens into the pools and acquire points for their tier \
\&#xNAN;*Staking here* [***ChaingGPT Pad Staking***](https://pad.chaingpt.org/#/staking-pools)[ ](https://app.chaingpt.org/staking)

Once staked and you have your assigned tier, you can begin participating in events on ChainGPT.&#x20;

Being admitted into the Preorder and Guaranteed allocation requires that a user register their interest; otherwise, they will not be able to participate in that round. Register interest will be available at least a few days prior to the IDO. Bronze tier members can access the Guaranteed round.

The ability to ‚Äúregister interest‚Äù becomes available at least a week before an IDO launch, giving users ample time to submit their intentions. In the majority of cases, the option will be available until the last 24/48 hours before launch. *(Exact dates will vary and be easily available for users to inspect).*

Users who do not meet the criteria for tier inclusion (Iron tier) or do not register their interest on time are not given access to the IDO during the FCFS‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFirst Come First Serve public round, which is not always sure to be available after the Guaranteed round.

\*Occasionally, Iron tier level users will be able to earn themselves priority inclusion into the Guaranteed Allocation round based on the completion of social campaigns.

***\*\*Note\*\****\
\&#xNAN;*Registration of interest is an option, not an obligation. If users do not take advantage of their locked position, they forgot their opportunity to participate in that round.*

# Introduction & Overview

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2Fl1uZWjC2lzgi8ISIrDNU%2Fimage%2038.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9376e8a0-0b17-4fec-b9e0-2068d310f9e5" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## What is CGPT DotFun?

**CGPT DotFun** is the first hybrid **AI Agent** and **Memecoin** launcher built natively on **BNB Chain**. It enables anyone to launch memecoins, autonomous AI Agents, or both (hybrids) in seconds ‚Äî with **no code, no gatekeeping, and no upfront costs**.

Whether you're a crypto degen, a meme lover, or an AI tinkerer, CGPT DotFun gives you the tools to create, grow, and monetize your ideas.


# How It Works

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FStUYBzVYtna8DtKjo3r5%2FPlatformUIcgptfun.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=4d0638bf-13af-418c-b76c-5902e16db064" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Launch Options

You can launch:

* **AI Agent only** ‚Äî e.g. MarketBot, Crypto NewsBot
* **Meme coin only** ‚Äî using a bonding curve sale
* **Hybrid (AI Agent + Token)** ‚Äî an autonomous bot with a memecoin economy

## Bonding Curves

A **bonding curve** is a smart-contract-based pricing curve where:

* Prices **increase with each buy** and **decrease with each sell**
* Tokens are sold until a fixed cap is reached
* Three launch strategies available ($5k / $10k / $20k market cap)

When the cap is reached:

* Token **graduates** to a DEX (PancakeSwap v2)
* Liquidity is created and locked for 1 year

## Token Launch Fees

* **Launching is free** (only gas in BNB required)
* **Buy fee:** 0.5% | **Sell fee:** 1%


# Tokenomics

Every token launched on CGPT DotFun follows a standard tokenomics model:

| Component              | Allocation          | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Supply**       | 1,000,000,000 (1B)  | Fixed, immutable per token                                              |
| **Bonding Curve Sale** | 87.5% (875M tokens) | Sold until raise target hit ($5k/$10k/$20k)                             |
| **DEX LP**             | 12.5% (125M tokens) | Paired with raised capital for PancakeSwap v2 liquidity (locked 1 year) |

## Graduation Event

* **5% service fee** deducted from the raise
* Remaining funds + 125M tokens ‚Üí liquidity pool
* LP locked for **1 year**

## Pre-Purchase Option

* Creators may **pre-buy up to 10%** of total supply (100M tokens)
* Shown transparently on the holders list

## Fair Launch Principles

* No pre-mines
* No insider/team/VC allocations
* No hidden taxes or transfer limits

## Cost per Token on DEX After Graduation

The cost per token on PancakeSwap after liquidity migration depends on the raise target and deducted service fee:

| Raise Target | Service Fee | Net Liquidity | Tokens in LP | Cost Per Token |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| $5,000       | $250        | $4,750        | 125M         | **$0.000038**  |
| $10,000      | $500        | $9,500        | 125M         | **$0.000076**  |
| $20,000      | $1,000      | $19,000       | 125M         | **$0.000152**  |

## Initial Market Cap (IMC)

Calculated using 87.5% of tokens (875M) multiplied by the post-graduation token price:

| Raise Target | Token Price | IMC          |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| $5,000       | $0.000038   | **$33,250**  |
| $10,000      | $0.000076   | **$66,500**  |
| $20,000      | $0.000152   | **$133,000** |

## Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)

Based on the full 1B token supply:

| Raise Target | Token Price | FDV          |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| $5,000       | $0.000038   | **$38,000**  |
| $10,000      | $0.000076   | **$76,000**  |
| $20,000      | $0.000152   | **$152,000** |

## Supply Cost Table: Estimated Cost to Buy X% of Supply

| Threshold = $5K | Threshold = $10K | Threshold = $20K | % Supply Purchased | Token Quantity |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| $571            | $1,143           | $2,286           | 10% (Max Pre-buy)  | 100M           |
| $1,714          | $3,429           | $6,857           | 30%                | 300M           |
| $2,286          | $4,571           | $9,143           | 40%                | 400M           |
| $2,857          | $5,714           | $11,429          | 50%                | 500M           |
| $3,429          | $6,857           | $13,714          | 60%                | 600M           |
| $4,000          | $8,000           | $16,000          | 70%                | 700M           |
| $4,571          | $9,143           | $18,286          | 80%                | 800M           |
| $5,000          | $10,000          | $20,000          | 87.5% (Graduation) | 875M           |
| N/A             | N/A              | N/A              | Remaining 12.5%    | 125M (LP)      |

These values are for illustration and assume uniform curve progression without gas fees or trade slippage.

* **$5,000**, **$10,000**, or **$20,000** fundraising target
* **87.5%** of token supply is sold during bonding curve
* Upon reaching target, bonding curve **graduates**, liquidity is migrated to PancakeSwap v2, and token becomes tradable on DEX.

***

Yes! Creating a token (memecoin or agent-backed) is **free**. You only pay blockchain gas fees in BNB.

***

#### What are the fees along bonding curve?

* **Buyers pay 0.5% fee**

* These are collected in the raise token (initially in $USDT, with $CGPT coming soon)
* Trading fees are shared between Creator and Platform (50% each when raised in USDT, and 70% for Creator when in CGPT)

***

* 5% service fee is shared between Creator and Platform (2.5% each when raised in USDT, and 3.5% for Creator when in CGPT)

***

#### What are the tokenomics of newly launched tokens on CGPT DotFun?

Every token launched via CGPT DotFun - whether a memecoin or an agent-backed token - follows a **standardized and transparent tokenomics structure**:

| Component              | Allocation                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Total Supply**       | **1,000,000,000 tokens (1B)** | Every launched token has a fixed and immutable total supply                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Bonding Curve Sale** | **87.5% (875M tokens)**       | These tokens are progressively sold via a bonding curve. Buyers can purchase them until the funding cap ($5k / $10k / $20k) is reached, at which point the token graduates and migrates to a DEX.                              |
| **DEX Liquidity Pool** | **12.5% (125M tokens)**       | Once the bonding curve graduates, this portion is paired with the raised funds ($USDT or $CGPT) to create an initial liquidity pool on **PancakeSwap v2**. The LP is then locked for **1 year** to ensure long-term stability. |

***

#### How is liquidity formed after the bonding curve ends?

* When the token hits the selected fundraising cap (e.g. $10,000), a **5% service fee** is deducted from the raised funds.
* The **remaining 95%** is paired with **12.5% of the total token supply (125M tokens)** to form the DEX liquidity pool.
* Example (for a $10K raise in USDT):
  * **$500 service fee** is split (2.5% to platform / 2.5% to creator in USDT, or 3.5% to creator if the raise currency is CGPT)
  * **$9,500 + 125M tokens** are added as initial liquidity on PancakeSwap
  * Liquidity is **locked for 1 year**, and LP tokens are staked on behalf of the creator

***

#### Are there any insider allocations or pre-mines?

No. CGPT DotFun follows **fair launch principles**:

* There is **no pre-mine**
* **No team or VC allocation**
* Creators can optionally pre-purchase **up to 10% of supply (100M tokens)** before the bonding curve starts. This is recorded transparently and shown in the UI.

***

#### What if my bonding curve doesn‚Äôt graduate?

* Trading remains open on bonding curve
* After selected days of inactivity, the token is flagged as **Inactive** and fees are moved to the treasury
* Fees go 100% to the protocol
* However, **any new trade** (buy or sell) **resets the inactivity status** and **reactivates the token**, effectively resuming the fundraising cycle on the bonding curve.

***

#### Can I pre-buy my own token?

Yes. Creators can pre-purchase **up to 10%** of their token supply before launch. Your wallet will be flagged on the holders list.

***

#### What is the service fee at graduation?

* **5% of raised amount** (e.g. $500 from $10k)
* Split between platform and creator:
  * **when raise in $USDT:** 2.5% to platform / 2.5% to creator
  * **when raise in $CGPT:** 1.5% to platform / 3.5% to creator

***

#### What is the AI Agent fee structure?

* **Agent setup fee:** $40 in CGPT tokens

## Announcing DegenPad: A Launchpad Designed by Degens, for Degens <a href="#id-3970" id="id-3970"></a>

Powered by formidable technology developed by [ChainGPT](https://www.chaingpt.org/), DegenPad isn‚Äôt just another IDO (Initial DEX Offering) platform ‚Äî it‚Äôs where degens find their edge in Web3.

## What is DegenPad? <a href="#id-12a0" id="id-12a0"></a>

[DegenPad](http://degenpad.com/) is the convergence of Web3 culture and high-stakes crypto. We‚Äôre here to demystify DeFi and make it both accessible and fun! Whether you‚Äôre a veteran trader or a crypto newcomer, DegenPad is your portal to epic project launches and in-depth Web3 community experiences.

## Inspiration Behind DegenPad <a href="#ec0f" id="ec0f"></a>

At DegenPad, we believe in uncovering diamonds in the rough ‚Äî promising projects that might be overlooked by the broader market but hold immense potential. Our mission is to give the community access to these hidden gems by focusing on projects that align with emerging market trends, particularly those with low fully diluted valuations (FDVs).

This trend, [as highlighted by Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/research/analysis/low-float-and-high-fdv-how-did-we-get-here) in a recent analysis, reflects a growing awareness of the sustainability challenges faced by tokens with inflated valuations. By focusing on projects with low FDVs, DegenPad aims to offer opportunities that provide upside potential and align with the increasing demand for more sustainable and transparent tokenomics.

# Tier System

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FHjXQUG5yOfNjRF0wqY1I%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=a6726f32-ce35-4075-8435-0b32fbe6cc0f" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Are you ready to access some of the most exclusive and promising crypto startups? [DegenPad](http://degenpad.com/) is your gateway to early-stage opportunities, which our team has thoroughly vetted.

To ensure fairness, we‚Äôve implemented a tiered access system that rewards community members who are serious about staking, regardless of their capital size.

**How does the Tier System work?**

The tier system at DegenPad is designed to reward participants based on their level of involvement in our platform. By staking $CGPT tokens, you can earn points that determine your tier, which in turn affects your access to different stages of opportunities within DegenPad. The more points you have, the higher your tier, and the greater your benefits.

Whether you have $10 to stake or $20,000, our tier system is balanced to ensure everyone can participate and benefit according to their contributions. However, it‚Äôs important to note that staking points from other products like ChainGPT Pad will only reflect 50% on DegenPad, and vice versa.

**Getting started on DegenPad**\
To join DegenPad and start participating in sales, you need to meet two simple criteria:

* **Complete KYC**: Verify your identity with our KYC partner to keep the platform secure.
* **Stake $CGPT**: Don‚Äôt be a Beta and stake the required amount of $CGPT to earn points and qualify for at least the Ape tier.

**Staking $CGPT**\
Staking $CGPT tokens is a way of showing your commitment to the DegenPad ecosystem. By staking, you unlock access to various utilities and begin accumulating points that determine your tier level.\
1 staked $CGPT = 1 tier point

Staking is divided into four pools based on time frames, each with its own point multiplier:

* 45 days = 1x multiplier
* 90 days = 1.3x multiplier
* 180 days = 1.5x multiplier
* 365 days = 2x multiplier

The longer you stake, the more points you earn, which boosts your tier status and rewards.

**Point System**\
The point system is the backbone of our tier structure. It calculates your participation impact based on the amount of $CGPT staked and the duration of your stake.

Total $CGPT tokens staked √ó pool multiplier = Tier Points

For example:

* Staking 1,000 $CGPT in the 45-day pool gives you 1,000 points.
* Staking 1,000 $CGPT in the 90-day pool gives you 1,300 points.
* Staking 1,000 $CGPT in the 180-day pool gives you 1,500 points.
* Staking 1,000 $CGPT in the 365-day pool gives you 2,000 points.

**Tier System**\
DegenPad features four tiers, each offering unique benefits. As you stake more $CGPT and accumulate points, you can climb the tiers and gain access to better opportunities.

## ü¶ß **Ape** <a href="#id-472d" id="id-472d"></a>

* Points Required: 2,000+
* Pool Weight: 1x Allocation Multiplier
* Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%
* Participation Rounds: #2 (First-Come, First-Served)
* Ape tier is designed for users with limited capital. Participation in the first round is not guaranteed, but select Ape users who complete social tasks can gain early access.

## üï∫ **Chad** <a href="#e6db" id="e6db"></a>

* Points Required: 20,000+
* Pool Weight: Minimum 4x Allocation Multiplier
* Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%
* Participation Rounds: #1 and #2 (Guaranteed and FCFS)
* Special Benefits: Guaranteed Whitelist for future NFT launches
* Chad tier guarantees access to the first round of IDO participation, with higher allocation weights.

## ü¶à **Shark** <a href="#id-2896" id="id-2896"></a>

* Points Required: 50,000+
* Pool Weight: Minimum 10x Allocation Multiplier
* Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%
* Participation Rounds: #1 and #2 (Guaranteed and FCFS)
* Special Benefits: Inclusion in Crowdfunding & Private Sales, Exclusive privileges in airdrops, Guaranteed Whitelist for future NFT launches, Shark tier members gain access to premium early-stage crowdfunding and private sales, along with enhanced airdrop opportunities.

## üêã **Whale** <a href="#b6aa" id="b6aa"></a>

* Points Required: 200,000+
* Pool Weight: Minimum 40x Allocation Multiplier
* Refund Eligibility: Yes, 100%
* Participation Rounds: #1 and #2 (Guaranteed and FCFS)
* Special Benefits: Token airdrops from incubated projects, Occasional NFT airdrops, Private group for sale access & voting, Freemium access to ChainGPT's AI Tools, Whale tier is the ultimate level, offering the most extensive benefits, including passive rewards through token and NFT airdrops, private sale access, and exclusive privileges.

**Note on Tier Allocation Multiplier**\
The Ape tier has a fixed 1x multiplier, regardless of points. However, in the Chad, Shark, and Whale tiers, the multiplier scales with your points within the tier. For example:

* A Chad with 20,000 points has a 4x multiplier, while one with 35,000 points has a 7x multiplier.
* A Shark with 50,000 points has a 10x multiplier, while one with 100,000 points has a 20x multiplier.
* A Whale with 200,000 points has a 40x multiplier, while one with 400,000 points may have a 80x multiplier.

The Whale tier has a theoretically limitless capacity, and multipliers are adjusted based on the final outcome of each IDO.

**Conclusion**\
The tier system at [DegenPad](http://degenpad.com/) is more than just a way to allocate opportunities; it‚Äôs a gateway to becoming part of an exclusive community dedicated to finding and supporting the most promising projects in the crypto space.

Whether you‚Äôre just starting or looking to maximize your involvement, our tier system offers a clear and rewarding path to success. Join us today and start climbing the ranks to unlock your full potential.

# Staking

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FS0rqC7QWO295r5Cm3A6Z%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=69ba200e-5144-42e0-988d-b867425bd372" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

At [DegenPad](http://degenpad.com/), we‚Äôve crafted a unique tier and staking system designed to cater to all types of participants, from those just starting out to seasoned veterans. This blog will guide you through the specifics of our tier system, explain how staking works within DegenPad, and highlight how you can optimize your participation.

### The DegenPad Tier System <a href="#id-496a" id="id-496a"></a>

The DegenPad tier system is designed to be fair and accessible, allowing participants at every level to benefit from our platform. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the tier structure:

1. **Ape**: *Just dipping your toes in? Welcome to the Ape tier, where even the smallest commitment lets you thrive in the Web3 jungle.* The Ape tier requires a minimum of 2,000 staking points. With a 1x pool weight/allocation multiplier, it‚Äôs perfect for those beginning their DeFi journey. At this level, you‚Äôll enjoy benefits like social interaction, refund eligibility, access to the FCFS (First Come, First Serve) round, and the ability to vote in DAO proposals.
2. **Chad**: *Got a bit more skin in the game? Chad tier lets you flex just enough to make your presence known, with perks that match your commitment.* The Chad tier kicks in at 20,000 staking points, offering a 4x pool weight/allocation multiplier. You‚Äôll gain additional benefits, such as a guaranteed round and increased participation rights, all while enjoying the privileges of the previous tier.
3. **Shark**: *Ready to make some serious moves? Dive into the Shark tier, where the waters are DEEP, and the rewards are bigger.* The Shark tier requires 50,000 staking points, providing a 10x pool weight/allocation multiplier. This tier grants you access to crowdfunding and private pools, incubation airdrops, and more advanced perks, setting you apart as a serious participant in the DegenPad ecosystem.
4. **Whale**: *The top of the food chain. If you‚Äôre here, you‚Äôre a Whale ‚Äî and you‚Äôre making waves in Web3.* The Whale tier, reserved for those with 200,000 staking points, offers a whopping 40x pool weight/allocation multiplier. This tier provides maximum benefits, including freemium access to ChainGPT AI tools, the ability to create DAO proposals, participate in node sales, and join the exclusive Private Whale Group. If you‚Äôre all-in on DeFi, this is where you want to be.

### How Staking Works in DegenPad <a href="#id-55b5" id="id-55b5"></a>

Staking is a critical part of participating in DegenPad‚Äôs tier system. Here‚Äôs how it works:

* **Staking Points**: When you stake tokens on DegenPad, you earn staking points. These points determine your tier within the system. The more tokens you stake, the more points you accumulate, and the higher the tier you can achieve.
* **Cross-Platform Integration**: Staking on DegenPad is interconnected with other platforms within the ChainGPT ecosystem. Specifically, if you stake on DegenPad Pools, 50% of your staking points will be reflected on ChangeGPT Pad, and vice versa. However, your full amount of staking points will count toward your voting power within the ChainGPT DAO, giving you influence across the entire ecosystem.
* **Incentive Structure**: The DegenPad staking system is designed to incentivize long-term participation. The longer you stake your tokens, the higher the multiplier applied to your staking points, meaning that consistent, long-term staking will help you climb the tiers more rapidly.
* **No APY, Just Rewards**: Unlike traditional staking platforms that offer an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) in the form of passive income, DegenPad focuses on direct participation rewards. By staking, you gain access to IDOs and other exclusive opportunities that are directly tied to your tier level.

### Benefits for $CGPT Stakers <a href="#id-6ee1" id="id-6ee1"></a>

$CGPT stakers are at the heart of the DegenPad ecosystem, and their commitment is rewarded with several exclusive benefits. By staking $CGPT, participants not only earn staking points that determine their tier within the DegenPad platform but also enjoy enhanced access to IDOs, priority in project allocations, and increased influence within the ChainGPT DAO.

Moreover, all ChainGPT Pad users who are staking on ChainGPT Pad will receive 50% of their staking points on DegenPad as well, enhancing their participation across both platforms. This cross-platform integration ensures that staking on either DegenPad or ChainGPT Pad contributes to your overall staking power, maximizing your influence and rewards within the entire ChainGPT ecosystem. With these advantages, $CGPT stakers are well-positioned to optimize their returns while playing a pivotal role in the growth and governance of both DegenPad and ChainGPT Pad.

### Maximizing Your Participation <a href="#id-8121" id="id-8121"></a>

To get the most out of DegenPad‚Äôs tier and staking system, consider the following strategies:

* **Start Early**: Begin staking as soon as possible to accumulate staking points and climb the tiers. Early participants will have the advantage of accessing initial IDOs and securing allocations before others.
* **Stake Consistently**: Consistent staking over time will allow you to benefit from the multiplier effect, helping you ascend to higher tiers more quickly.
* **Leverage Cross-Platform Points**: By understanding how your staking points impact your status across both DegenPad and ChangeGPT Pad, you can strategically allocate your staking to maximize benefits across the ecosystem.
* **Engage with the DAO**: Remember that your staking points also contribute to your voting power within the ChainGPT DAO. Engage in governance decisions to help shape the future of the platform while reaping the rewards of your staked tokens.

### Conclusion <a href="#id-4930" id="id-4930"></a>

The DegenPad tier and staking system is designed to be inclusive, rewarding, and strategically aligned with the broader ChainGPT ecosystem. Whether you‚Äôre just starting your DeFi journey or you‚Äôre a seasoned Web3 users, there‚Äôs a place for you at DegenPad.

By understanding and engaging with our tier structure and staking mechanisms, you can optimize your participation and maximize your potential returns. Join the DegenPad community today, start staking, and begin your journey!

# IDO Rounds Explained

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2F2wlxiQ5mi63WzXWr7gfe%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4c2e5902-7efa-4269-8dc3-696e070fcd5b" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

DegenPad leverages a two-phased approach for conducting the launches of IDO projects.&#x20;

By having multiple rounds, a higher degree of commitment from the CGPT user base can be established, and a larger potential opportunity for projects to successfully complete their intended sales.&#x20;

### **Round #1 (Guaranteed Allocation)**

Round one of an IDO will be granted only to the users who signal their desire to participate by registering their interest prior to the start of the IDO. (Typicall&#x79;*, Registration will open a week prior and last until 24 hours before launch*).

This round is reserved for the top staking tier groups, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. However, every IDO is launched through social campaigns that allow a limited group of fast-acting Bronze tier members to earn their inclusion into the guaranteed round.

Round #1 will last for 24 hours unless otherwise specified.

### **Round #2 (FCFS - First Come First Serve)**

Round two, the First Come First Serve, is open to the broader ChainGPT community. There is no requirement to register interest for FCFS; however, waiting for it runs the risk of users being unable to participate due to early completion. Here, all KYC tier members can join at will.

Round #2 will last for 12 hours unless otherwise specified.

*Should a project reach 99% of its maximum IDO capacity during the first round of guaranteed allocations, the IDO will immediately conclude the first round. At least 1% of the capacity will always be reserved for the second round, designated for First Come, First Serve (FCFS) participants.*

# Flexible Refund Policy

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FghXcDRgoGT3aj1sR4nJa%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=18786575-4258-40ae-8b15-9b774d028057" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

[DegenPad](http://degenpad.com/) has been designed with maximum security considerations for its users. To mitigate risks, protect against malicious activity, and ensure that projects listed on the platform behave with integrity, DegenPad has implemented a novel refund policy.

### How Our Refund Policy Works <a href="#c38d" id="c38d"></a>

Following the successful completion of an IDO and the project‚Äôs token initial listing, the refund grace period begins.

During the refund grace period, DegenPad users will have two options in their dashboard: ‚ÄúClaim‚Äù and ‚ÄúRefund.‚Äù At any point within the grace period, users have the right to withdraw from participation by simply selecting ‚ÄúRefund.‚Äù Once a user confirms a refund, their initial contributions will be released directly back to their wallet addresses.

Please note that if a user selects ‚ÄúClaim‚Äù at any point, they will collect their token allocation and, by default, will no longer be able to refund it.

Every IDO on the DegenPad platform undergoes a qualitative assessment before listing, which will determine the length of the refund grace period. Typically, this period spans 7 days, but under certain circumstances, the DegenPad team may adjust it as needed.

### Refund Qualification <a href="#b501" id="b501"></a>

Every participant tier, from Ape to Whale, qualifies for a 100% refund on their committed funds, as long as they make their request within the allotted refund period and do not claim before the period expires.

### Conclusion <a href="#id-1f19" id="id-1f19"></a>

The presence of a refund policy is intended to protect the DegenPad community while incentivizing participating projects to operate with maximum integrity.

## Refund Policy FAQs: <a href="#f147" id="f147"></a>

**1) For how long can I request a Refund?**\
As long as you do not ‚ÄúClaim‚Äù within the refund grace period, you can request a refund anytime before the grace period elapses.

**2) Do I get a full refund?**\
Yes, refunds are 100% of your allocation.

**3) Can I request a refund after I ‚ÄúClaim‚Äù?**\
No, by opting to claim, you forfeit the right to refunds.

**4) How is this beneficial to projects?**\
With a refund policy in place, projects are provided with solid guidelines by which they must abide in order to offer the highest level of service to users. It acts as an automated security shield. With these guardrails in place, projects of lower quality will be discouraged from attempting to infiltrate our community.

</details>

<details>

<summary>2. <strong>What is an IDO?</strong></summary>

IDO stands for Initial DEX Offering. It is a method of public fundraising that pools capital from retail users by utilizing a decentralized platform as the venue for facilitating the transactions. This model is superior to the preceding ICO model because the platform can provide a higher degree of security for end users by collecting the funding and only releasing to the projects after the satisfaction of a certain criteria.

</details>

<details>

<summary>3. <strong>What is crowdfunding/private sale?</strong></summary>

The crowdfunding/private sale is a very early round of fundraising that takes place right before an IDO. Typically just a day or so before an IDO launch. These rounds tend to offer superior rates but also incur prolonged vesting periods.

</details>

<details>

<summary>4. <strong>What is FCFS or First Come First Serve round?</strong></summary>

FCFS is the acronym for First-Come-First-Serve, and it refers to the round of fundraising that becomes available to the general public after the guaranteed round. As the name might suggest, FCFS rounds are based on timing, available token supplies are sold to participants that arrive ahead of others.

</details>

## **IDO Allocation & Policy**

<details>

<summary>1. <strong>Can I participate in IDOs right after purchasing $CGPT?</strong></summary>

Almost. Before being able to participate in the IDO‚Äôs users must do two more actions. First, once $CGPT is acquired, users must make sure to have enough tier points for inclusion, if yes, then simply stake their tokens in the official staking dashboard. Second, they must pass KYC.

</details>

<details>

<summary>2. <strong>Is there a refund policy?</strong></summary>

Yes. Every IDO launch will have a ‚Äúrefund grace period‚Äù lasting 7‚Äì14 days on average that allows participating users added time to evaluate their decisions before finalizing the commitments.

</details>

<details>

<summary>3. <strong>Do I have to KYC in order to access the Launchpad?</strong></summary>

&#x20;Yes. KYC is required for participating at any tier level. The KYC process has been made maximally simple through our partner Blockpass. To sign up, please follow our official link: <http://url.chaingpt.org/kyc>

</details>

<details>

<summary>4. <strong>How is Pool Weight Calculated?</strong></summary>

&#x20;Pool weight is calculated based on the distribution of tier points among participating members and their corresponding tier levels. Every pool has a structured base range that is dependent on their staking tier points.

</details>

<details>

<summary>5. <strong>What crypto tokens can be used to participate in IDOs?</strong></summary>

‚Ä¢ Stablecoins: USDT, USDC, BUSD

‚Ä¢ Cryptocurrencies: BNB, ETH

</details>

<details>

<summary>6. <strong>What countries are restricted from IDOs?</strong></summary>

Persons from the United States and Canada cannot participate in any IDO due to the lack of clear regulations in the crypto space.

Countries restricted or sanctioned include: Afghanistan, Algeria, American Samoa, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Botswana, Canada, Central African Republic, China, Cuba, Egypt, Guam, Hong Kong, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Morocco, Nepal, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Yemen.

</details>

## **Tiers and Staking** <a href="#id-3776" id="id-3776"></a>

<details>

<summary>1. <strong>Can I stake into multiple Pools and still acquire points?</strong></summary>

Yes. If you wish to split up your $CGPT stake across different pools, the Launchpad will calculate your points based on their individual placements. The minimum number of tokens required is 1,000 $CGPT.

</details>

# Understanding Low FDV Projects on DegenPad

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FDFcO0l9R5d36kAOEIlWo%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5f4503f1-2491-45c4-a19d-0c6649ba5811" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Web3 users and traders are constantly looking for projects that offer significant upside potential while minimizing risk. One critical metric that helps gauge a project‚Äôs long-term value is Fully Diluted Valuation or FDV. Recently, [even major platforms like Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/research/analysis/low-float-and-high-fdv-how-did-we-get-here) have taken steps to address the challenges posed by high FDV tokens with low circulating supply, underscoring the importance of this metric in creating sustainable market environments.

At [DegenPad](http://degenpad.com/), we‚Äôve recognized the significance of FDV and have made it a cornerstone of our launchpad‚Äôs project selection process. This blog will explore what FDV is, why low FDV projects can be highly attractive, and how DegenPad leverages this metric to bring you the most promising opportunities in the Web3 space.

### What is Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)? <a href="#id-1fdb" id="id-1fdb"></a>

Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) is a metric used to estimate a cryptocurrency project‚Äôs potential market capitalization. It considers the tokens currently in circulation and the total number of tokens that could be in circulation if all potential tokens were issued.

This includes tokens reserved for future use, such as those allocated for team members, advisors, or future development activities, and those to be released through staking rewards, airdrops, or other mechanisms.

FDV is calculated by multiplying the total possible supply of a token by its current price. For example, if a project has a maximum supply of 1 million tokens and the current price per token is $10, the FDV would be $10 million. This metric provides a broader view of the project‚Äôs potential value, accounting for all tokens that could eventually enter the market.

### Why Focus on Low FDV Projects? <a href="#d605" id="d605"></a>

Low FDV projects are those where the fully diluted valuation is relatively modest compared to the current market capitalization. This can be indicative of several things, including:

1. **Room for Growth**: A low FDV suggests significant room for price appreciation as the project progresses. Participants can benefit from early entry before the broader market fully recognizes the project‚Äôs value.
2. **Lower Initial Capitalization**: Projects with low FDV often have a smaller initial market cap, which can attract users looking for undervalued opportunities. This can mean the project is still in its early stages, with plenty of growth potential.
3. **Risk Management**: Low FDV projects might present a lower downside risk relative to their potential upside. This is because the market has not yet fully priced in all future tokens, and the project‚Äôs valuation remains relatively conservative.
4. **Incentive for Stakeholders**: For projects with a lower FDV, the founding team and early participants are often more motivated to grow the project, as they hold a significant portion of the total supply that will only be released over time. This alignment of incentives can lead to stronger commitment and better outcomes for all participants.

### How DegenPad Selects Low FDV Projects <a href="#id-208a" id="id-208a"></a>

At DegenPad, we‚Äôve made it our mission to identify and launch the most promising low FDV projects in the Web3 space. Our selection process is meticulous and designed to ensure that the projects we support are innovative and offer real value to users.

1. **Rigorous Screening Process**: We start by evaluating each project‚Äôs fundamentals. This includes the team‚Äôs experience, the project‚Äôs technology, market potential, and overall vision. Only projects with strong foundations make it to the next stage.
2. **Focus on Potential and Innovation**: We look for projects that bring something new ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a novel use case, a unique technological solution, or a fresh approach to an existing problem. Innovation is key to standing out in the crowded crypto market.
3. **Strategic Partnerships**: We collaborate with projects that have the backing of reputable partners. This provides additional validation and ensures that the project has the resources and support needed to succeed.
4. **Balancing Risk and Reward**: By focusing on low FDV projects, we aim to offer our community opportunities with high upside potential while managing downside risk. Our goal is to empower users to make informed decisions and participate in the growth of the next big thing in Web3.

# Delegate Staking Functionality

Delegate Staking on DegenPad

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FyIE8ohOUMNqBaSa17VmC%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ec15c404-1d9f-45af-b71d-7e32315fab6f" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Delegate Staking allows users to give their staking points to others and to share their staking points to their other wallets.&#x20;

This means a user can assign (delegate) their points to another user, who can then use them for other functionalities of the application. With the staking points they receive, they can achieve a tier level, which grants them allocations for IDO pools, participation in pools, and access to other features.&#x20;

Sharing points across multiple wallets of their own also allows them to engage in the ChainGPT ecosystem with more ease. And also adds an added layer of security.

Additionally, users have the ability to take back (revoke) the points they previously delegated or remove (delete) them entirely.

## Staking Balance & Delegation Summary

Before delegating staking points, users will see a staking summary panel displaying their current staking balance and delegation status. Below is a breakdown of the key metrics shown:

* Total Staking Points: Displays the total staking points a user owns.
* Points Available to Delegate: Shows the number of staking points that can still be delegated.
* Total Staking Points Delegated: Represents the total amount of staking points the user has already delegated.
* Staking Points from Delegation: Indicates the number of staking points received from other users via delegation.

3. ### Remove Delegated Staking Points

Deletion allows users to permanently remove staking points they have previously delegated. Unlike revocation, where points are returned to the original user's balance, deletion completely erases the delegation record. This can be useful if the user wants to remove old or unnecessary delegations.

#### To delete delegated staking points, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the Staking Pools Page: Open the application and go to the Staking Pools page.

## Important Points

* Tier Changes with Staking Points: When a user receives staking points from another wallet, their tier level changes accordingly. Similarly, if the original owner revokes the delegated staking points, the recipient‚Äôs tier will be adjusted again.
* Restriction on Delegated Points Redistribution: A user cannot delegate staking points that they have received through delegation from another user. Delegation is only allowed from the original staking points owned by the user.
* Delegation Restrictions for Active IDO Pools:
* A user cannot delegate staking points if they or the recipient have already participated in an active IDO pool.
* Similarly, the user cannot revoke or delete delegated points if the recipient is still part of an active IDO pool.
* If a user tries to delegate, revoke, or delete staking points while they or the recipient have already participated in an active IDO pool, they will receive an error message.

# Smart-Contracts

Repository that tracks all ChainGPT Smart Contracts

# Web3 AI Chatbot & LLM (API & SDK)

## ChainGPT Web3 AI Chatbot & LLM (API & SDK) - Overview and Architecture

**ChainGPT Web3 AI Chatbot & LLM** is a Web3-native AI assistant built specifically for the crypto world. It combines a powerful large language model with deep blockchain expertise, enabling seamless integration of crypto-aware AI into your applications. The model is trained on blockchain data (smart contracts, DeFi protocols, NFTs, DAOs) and real-time market information, making it ideal for use cases like customer support, on-chain analytics, trading assistance, and community engagement.

Already trusted by leading platforms like Binance Square, BNB Chain, and TronDAO, ChainGPT‚Äôs Web3 LLM is purpose-built for the next generation of Web3 applications.

**Pricing:** The API is credit-based ‚Äì each API or SDK request consumes **0.5 credits** (approximately $0.005 USD), and enabling chat history for a request consumes an **additional 0.5 credits**. Ensure your ChainGPT account has sufficient credit balance; if you run out, API calls will return an error (HTTP 402/403 for insufficient credits).

***

### **Key Differentiators:**&#x20;

ChainGPT‚Äôs Web3 AI stands out from general-purpose LLMs in several ways:

<table><thead><tr><th width="158.46484375">Title</th><th>What It Does</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Web3 Domain Expertise</strong></td><td>Fine-tuned on crypto and blockchain content (smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, tokenomics). This domain-specific training means it excels at explaining or analyzing crypto concepts and code, unlike generic AI models.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Real-Time Insights</strong></td><td>Able to pull live on-chain data and market information on the fly. This supports use cases like real-time price checks, blockchain explorer queries, trend analysis, and more, ensuring answers are always up-to-date.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Crypto-Specific Utilities</strong></td><td>Includes built-in capabilities for tasks like smart contract auditing, code generation, NFT creation, and technical analysis, which traditionally require separate developer tools.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Multi-Channel Deployment</strong></td><td>Can be deployed across websites, dApps, Discord, Telegram, and other platforms for a consistent AI assistant experience. A single ChainGPT-powered chatbot can serve users across multiple channels.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Security &#x26; Privacy First</strong></td><td>All data is encrypted in transit and stored in isolated environments. ChainGPT does <strong>not</strong> use your data to train its models. This makes it enterprise-safe and privacy-conscious for production use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

### Architecture & Integration Flow

Integrating the ChainGPT Web3 AI Chatbot into your tech stack is straightforward. Your application (front-end or back-end) communicates with ChainGPT‚Äôs cloud-hosted AI service via REST API calls or through the provided SDK.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FisfEZpBhB9wuENlA9hVG%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=46326c3d-5567-456d-8c91-bcd7044c42be" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

At a high level, the interaction flow works as follows:

1. **User Question:** A user interacts with your interface (website, mobile app, dApp, chat widget, etc.) and asks a question or issues a command. For example: *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the current ETH price?‚Äù* or *‚ÄúExplain this smart contract code.‚Äù*
2. **Application Request:** Your application (client-side or server) sends the user‚Äôs query to the ChainGPT service, either by making a direct HTTPS request to the API or by calling the ChainGPT SDK. The request includes your API key for authentication, and can optionally include parameters like a desired response tone or additional context data.
3. **AI Processing in Cloud:** ChainGPT‚Äôs backend receives the request and the Web3 LLM processes it. The model uses its built-in crypto knowledge base and, if needed, fetches live on-chain or off-chain data to answer the query. If you‚Äôve supplied custom context (see **Customization via AI Hub** below), that information is incorporated as well. The AI then generates a response‚Äîeither answering the question or performing the requested analysis.
4. **Response Delivery:** The answer is returned to your application through the API/SDK. If you used the SDK, it will handle parsing the response (and streaming it, if applicable) for you. If you used the raw REST API, you‚Äôll receive a JSON response containing the result. Your application can then display or utilize the answer (e.g. rendering the chatbot‚Äôs reply in your UI).
5. **Multi-Turn Conversations:** ChainGPT supports follow-up questions and contextual conversations. Your app can send subsequent queries along with a conversation identifier or the prior chat history so that ChainGPT knows the context (previous Q\&A) and can respond accordingly. The SDK simplifies this by managing conversation state for you, while the REST API provides parameters to handle it (more on this in the sections below). This allows users to have natural back-and-forth dialogues with the AI.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** All heavy AI computation (GPU model inference, data fetching, etc.) is handled on ChainGPT‚Äôs cloud servers. Your integration remains lightweight‚Äîyour app sends a request and renders the AI‚Äôs reply. There‚Äôs no need to run any AI model locally, which keeps your deployment scalable and efficient.
{% endhint %}

***

### Integration Options: REST API vs JavaScript SDK

**You can integrate ChainGPT in two ways:** via a RESTful HTTP API, or via the official JavaScript/TypeScript SDK. Both methods provide the same core Web3 AI capabilities, but offer different developer experiences. The table below compares these options:

<table><thead><tr><th width="95.77734375">Aspect</th><th>REST API (HTTP calls)</th><th>JavaScript SDK (Node/Browser)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Platform</strong></td><td>Language-agnostic ‚Äì works with any environment that can send HTTPS requests (cURL, Python, Java, Go, etc.). Ideal for server-side integration or non-JS languages.</td><td>Designed for JavaScript/TypeScript projects (Node.js backends, browser apps with bundlers, React, etc.). Distributed via NPM for easy inclusion.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Setup</strong></td><td>No additional library required. You manually make HTTP requests to ChainGPT‚Äôs endpoints, adding headers (e.g. <code>Authorization: Bearer &#x3C;API_KEY></code>) and parsing JSON responses yourself.</td><td>Install the SDK package (<code>npm install @chaingpt/generalchat</code>). Import it and initialize with your API key. The SDK handles authentication headers internally, and provides convenient methods (e.g. <code>createChatBlob</code>, <code>createChatStream</code>) instead of manual HTTP calls.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Features</strong></td><td>Full low-level control over requests and responses. Supports all features (including streaming) via direct HTTP. You manage details like JSON payload construction, maintaining conversation IDs, and interpreting HTTP status codes or errors.</td><td>Higher-level abstraction with built-in utilities: streaming handled via Node.js streams or async iterators, automatic conversation context management, and TypeScript type definitions. Simplifies error handling (throws exceptions or emits events instead of raw HTTP codes) and reduces boilerplate.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>When to Use</strong></td><td>Use the REST API if you‚Äôre working in a non-JS environment or prefer to avoid external libraries. It‚Äôs ideal for backends in Python, Java, etc., or any scenario where adding an SDK isn‚Äôt feasible. This approach offers language flexibility at the cost of a bit more manual coding.</td><td>Use the SDK if you are building in JavaScript/TypeScript and want to integrate quickly and reliably. It eliminates a lot of boilerplate and potential mistakes by handling the HTTP calls under the hood. Perfect for Node.js services or web apps that want a plug-and-play chatbot client.</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

### Customization via AI Hub (Tone & Context)

One of ChainGPT‚Äôs most powerful features is the ability to customize the chatbot‚Äôs behavior and knowledge **without** writing complex prompts or training a model from scratch. Through the ChainGPT **AI Hub** (the web portal for configuring your AI agent), you can tailor the assistant‚Äôs personality and context to fit your project. Key customization options include:

* **Tone & Persona:** Define the AI‚Äôs tone and style to match your brand or use-case. You can choose from preset personas (e.g. friendly, professional, humorous) or define a custom tone. This setting influences the style of all responses. For example, a friendly tone might use casual language and emojis, whereas a formal tone would be more concise and polite.
* **Project Knowledge Base:** Provide your project‚Äôs specific details‚Äîsuch as the project name, description, website, documentation links, token information, FAQs‚Äîvia the AI Hub. The ChainGPT LLM will incorporate this information when answering questions. For instance, if a user asks ‚ÄúWhat is this project about?‚Äù, the chatbot will respond with the details you provided (mission, features, tokenomics, etc.) instead of a generic answer.
* **Context Injection:** Dynamically inject additional context on a per-request basis. Along with a user‚Äôs question, your application can send extra information (by setting `useCustomContext: true` and including a `contextInjection` object in the API/SDK call). This could be a specific document, a recent announcement, or any relevant text snippet. The injected context will influence the answer for that query, allowing fine-tuned responses. For example, you might ask a question about a particular whitepaper and inject that whitepaper text as context, so the AI can draw on it.
* **Knowledge Extensions:** Extend the AI‚Äôs knowledge beyond its base training data. In the AI Hub, you can link external resources (like your platform‚Äôs docs or blockchain explorers) or upload files for the AI to reference. This makes the chatbot capable of pulling in information from those sources when needed. For example, you could enable it to answer questions using your product‚Äôs documentation or to fetch on-chain statistics about your token.

Using these customization features, you can tailor the AI‚Äôs output to be highly relevant and aligned with your project, **without** having to prepend every prompt with a long description. Once configured, the context and tone settings are stored securely in the AI Hub and automatically applied to all requests made with your API key (unless you override them on a specific request). This approach is more manageable and consistent than manual prompt engineering for each query.

### Getting Started: Onboarding & API Keys

Integrating ChainGPT is designed to be fast and friction‚Äëfree. Follow these steps to get up and running:

1. **Sign In & Access the** [**API Dashboard**](https://app.chaingpt.org/apidashboard) **on ChainGPT's AI Hub**
2. **Generate Your API Key**
   * In AI Hub‚Äôs **API Dashboard**, click **"Create New Secret Key"**.
   * Label it for your project, then copy the key when it appears (you won‚Äôt be able to view it again).
   * If you ever lose it, simply revoke and generate a new one.
3. **Customize your API key‚Äôs context by providing (optional step):**&#x20;
   * Company and product details.
   * Crypto‚Äëtoken metadata (if applicable).
   * Social media links.
   * Uploaded knowledge‚Äëbase documents so the AI has complete, up‚Äëto‚Äëdate information about your organization.
4. **Secure Your Key**
   * Treat your API key like a password.
   * **Never** hard‚Äëcode it in client‚Äëside code or commit it to a public repo.
   * In server environments (Node.js, Python, etc.), store it in environment variables or a secrets manager.
   * If calling from a browser, proxy all requests through your backend to keep the key hidden.
5. **Choose Your Integration Method**
   * **REST API:** Make HTTPS requests directly to `https://api.chaingpt.org` (e.g. `POST /chat/stream`).
   * **JavaScript SDK:** Install with `npm install @chaingpt/generalchat` and call methods like `createChatBlob()` or `createChatStream()`.
6. **Test, Tweak & Go Live**
   * In development, experiment with your prompts, chat history settings, and context injection in AI Hub.
   * Monitor usage and credits in the AI Hub dashboard to avoid interruptions.
   * When ready, deploy your integration to production‚Äîupdates to tone or context in AI Hub take effect immediately, no code changes required.

#### Security & API Key Management

* **Multiple Keys:** Create separate keys for dev, staging, and production to isolate usage and simplify revocation.
* **Least Privilege:** Only grant each key the permissions it needs. Revoke unused keys promptly.
* **Encryption:** All API calls occur over HTTPS; ChainGPT does **not** train on your data, ensuring privacy.
* **Credit Monitoring:** Each chat request costs **0.5 credits**, and enabling chat history costs **an additional 0.5 credits**. Keep an eye on your balance in AI Hub to avoid 402/403 errors.

### 1. Prerequisites ‚úîÔ∏é

| What you need                  | Notes                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ChainGPT account + API key** | Create a key in **AI Hub ‚Üí API Dashboard** and copy it once.                                  |
| **Credits**                    | Each request = **0.5 credits**.Turning `chatHistory` **on** adds **+0.5 credits** per call    |
| **HTTP client**                | cURL, Postman, `fetch`, `axios`, etc.                                                         |
| **(If using SDK)** Node ‚â• 14   | Install from npm.                                                                             |
| **Secure key storage**         | Put the key in an env var, secret manager, or server config‚Äî**never** ship it to the browser. |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip**  export `CHAINGPT_API_KEY="sk‚Äë***"` so the examples just work.
{% endhint %}

***

### 2. Integration Options

| Option             | When to choose               | How it works                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **REST API**       | Any language / server        | `POST https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream` (single endpoint for blob **and** streaming) |
| **JavaScript SDK** | Node or a build‚Äëstep web app | `npm install @chaingpt/generalchat` ‚Üí call `createChatBlob()` or `createChatStream()`    |

***

### 3. QuickStart via REST API

#### **3.1 Authentication & Endpoint**

```bash
Authorization: Bearer $CHAINGPT_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
POST https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream
```

{% hint style="info" %}
There is **no separate `/chat` endpoint**‚Äîall chat traffic goes to `/chat/stream`.
{% endhint %}

#### **3.2 Single‚ÄëShot (JSON ‚Äúblob‚Äù) response**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHAINGPT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model":"general_assistant",
        "question":"Hello, ChainGPT! Who are you?",
        "chatHistory":"off"
      }'
```

If you don‚Äôt treat the response as a stream, cURL (or your HTTP client) waits until the LLM finishes, then returns one JSON:

```json
{ "status":true,
  "data": { "bot": "Hello! I‚Äôm ChainGPT, a Web3‚Äësavvy AI assistant‚Ä¶" } }
```

#### **3.3 Streaming in real time**

```bash
curl -N -X POST https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHAINGPT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model":"general_assistant",
        "question":"Give me the latest ETH stats.",
        "chatHistory":"off"
      }'
```

`-N` turns off buffering so you see partial chunks instantly. Concatenate chunks on arrival until the connection closes.

#### **3.4 Conversation Memory (chat history)**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHAINGPT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model":"general_assistant",
        "question":"Remember my token ABC and what it does.",
        "chatHistory":"on",
        "sdkUniqueId":"user42"
      }'
```

Subsequent calls with the **same** `sdkUniqueId` and `chatHistory:"on"` include the prior Q\&A so the bot answers in context.

*Cost impact:* `chatHistory:"on"` consumes **+0.5 credits** per request.

#### **3.5 Custom Context & Tone**

```bash
{
  "question":"Explain our project.",
  "useCustomContext":true,
  "contextInjection":{
     "companyName":"ABC Crypto",
     "companyDescription":"A DeFi yield platform",
     "aiTone":"PRE_SET_TONE",
     "selectedTone":"FRIENDLY"
  }
}
```

Set `useCustomContext:true`; include only the fields you need. Omit `contextInjection` to fall back to the default context configured in AI Hub.

***

### 4. QuickStart via JavaScript SDK

#### **4.1 Install & init**

```bash
npm install @chaingpt/generalchat

# or 
yarn add @chaingpt/generalchat
```

```js
import { GeneralChat } from "@chaingpt/generalchat";
const chat = new GeneralChat({ apiKey: process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY });
```

#### **4.2 Blob response**

```js
const res = await chat.createChatBlob({
  question: "Hi, what is ChainGPT?",
  chatHistory: "off"
});
console.log(res.data.bot);
```

`createChatBlob()` buffers the `/chat/stream` response for you.

#### **4.3 Streaming response**

```js
const stream = await chat.createChatStream({
  question: "Summarise the last BTC block.",
  chatHistory: "off"
});
for await (const chunk of stream) process.stdout.write(chunk);
```

#### **4.4 Chat history & context**

```js
await chat.createChatBlob({
  question: "Track ABC token price.",
  chatHistory: "on",
  sdkUniqueId: "user42",
  useCustomContext: true
});
```

SDK parameters match the REST fields 1‚Äëfor‚Äë1.

### 5. Error Codes ‚Äî Quick Reference

| Code          | Meaning                  | Fix                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **401**       | Missing / bad API key    | Check `Authorization` header.  |
| **402 / 403** | Out of credits           | Top‚Äëup in AI Hub.              |
| **400**       | Bad JSON / missing field | Verify `model` and `question`. |
| **5xx**       | Server error             | Retry after brief delay.       |

***

### 6. Best Practices

* **Hide the key.** Never embed it in client JavaScript‚Äîproxy via your backend.
* **Watch credits.** One call = **0.5 credits**; history = +0.5. Set alerts.
* **Use unique `sdkUniqueId`.** One per user/session keeps histories clean.
* **Handle stream ‚Äòend‚Äô & ‚Äòerror‚Äô.** Always close or retry gracefully.
* **Stay updated.** Check the npm changelog for new SDK features or model IDs.

# API Reference

## ChainGPT Web3 LLM API ‚Äì REST API Reference

**ChainGPT‚Äôs Web3 LLM API** is a RESTful interface that lets developers integrate a Web3-aware AI assistant into their applications. This single endpoint can return the AI‚Äôs answer either as a **complete JSON response** or as a **streaming response** (token by token), making it suitable for chatbot UIs, text analysis, content generation, and more. The API supports custom context (to tailor the AI‚Äôs persona or knowledge), conversation memory, and tone control for flexible integration into various use cases.

{% hint style="info" %}
‚ö†Ô∏è **Single Endpoint Design:** The ChainGPT Web3 LLM API uses **one endpoint** for chat completions. There is **no separate `/chat` endpoint** for non-streaming responses. All requests should be sent to `POST https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream`. By default this returns a full JSON response. If you prefer a streamed answer, you simply adjust how you call the endpoint (e.g. using an HTTP stream or setting `responseType: "stream"` in your client). **Do not** send requests to `/chat` (doing so will result in a 404 Not Found).
{% endhint %}

***

### Authentication

All requests require an API key for authentication. Obtain your API key from the ChainGPT web app (AI Hub) ‚Äì go to the **API Dashboard**, create a new secret key, and customize your key‚Äôs context (company info, token details, tone, etc.) if desired. **Keep this key secure.** Include the API key in your request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you generated. Each API call deducts credits from your ChainGPT account (see **Credit Usage** below).

***

### Endpoint: `POST /chat/stream` ‚Äì Chat Completion

Use this endpoint to submit a prompt or question to the AI and get a response. The behavior of the response depends on how you make the request:

* **Standard (Buffered) Response:** A normal POST request will wait for the AI to generate the complete answer, then return an HTTP 200 with the full JSON result.
* **Streaming Response:** If you prefer to receive the answer incrementally (for real-time display), you can open the request as a stream. The server will send back chunks of the answer text as they are generated, and terminate the stream when complete.

Regardless of response mode, you use the **same endpoint and request format**. The difference is purely client-side: streaming versus waiting for completion.

#### Request Body Parameters

All parameters are sent as a JSON object in the POST request body. Required fields must be present, while optional fields can be omitted to use their default behavior.

* **`model`** (`string`, **required**): ID of the model to use. For the general ChainGPT assistant, use `"general_assistant"`. *(At present this is the primary model available for this endpoint.)*
* **`question`** (`string`, **required**): The user's prompt or query for the AI. This is the message or instruction you want the assistant to respond to.
* **`chatHistory`** (`string`, optional, default `"off"`): Controls conversation memory. Set to `"on"` to enable the AI to remember this question and answer for future requests (allowing multi-turn conversations). If `"on"`, the API will store this Q\&A pair and include relevant history in subsequent answers. If `"off"`, no history is used or stored ‚Äì the assistant treats each request independently.
* **`sdkUniqueId`** (`string`, optional): A unique session identifier for grouping chat history. If you have multiple distinct conversations or users, provide a consistent `sdkUniqueId` for each thread or user. When `chatHistory` is `"on"`, this ensures the assistant only uses history from the specified session. If omitted, all history-enabled requests under your API key share a single combined history context.
* **`useCustomContext`** (`boolean`, optional, default `false`): Whether to apply custom context to this request. If `false`, the assistant responds with its default behavior (or any default context configured for your API key in the AI Hub). If `true`, the assistant will incorporate additional context:
  * If you **do not** provide a `contextInjection` object, the server will use the **default context tied to your API key** (e.g. your saved company info and tone preferences in the AI Hub).
  * If you **do** provide a `contextInjection` object in the request, that data will **override** any default context for this response (the custom context applies only to this request).
* **`contextInjection`** (`object`, optional): An object containing custom context details to inject into the conversation. This allows you to dynamically override or supplement the AI‚Äôs knowledge and behavior. To use `contextInjection`, you **must** set `useCustomContext: true`. Any fields you include here will influence the assistant‚Äôs reply (fields omitted will use your API key‚Äôs defaults, or be ignored if no default exists). See **Context Injection Fields** below for all supported sub-fields.

A minimal request might include just the required `model` and `question`. More complex requests can turn on `chatHistory` or supply context/tone parameters as needed. **All fields should be in a single JSON object**. For example:

```
{
  "model": "general_assistant",
  "question": "How do Ethereum smart contracts work?",
  "chatHistory": "off"
}
```

This asks the AI a question without any custom context or history. In contrast:

```
{
  "model": "general_assistant",
  "question": "Tell me about our project.",
  "chatHistory": "on",
  "sdkUniqueId": "user-12345",
  "useCustomContext": true,
  "contextInjection": {
    "companyName": "Acme DeFi",
    "companyDescription": "Acme DeFi is a decentralized finance platform offering yield farming.",
    "cryptoToken": true,
    "tokenInformation": {
      "tokenName": "AcmeToken",
      "tokenSymbol": "ACME",
      "blockchain": ["ETHEREUM", "POLYGON"]
    },
    "aiTone": "PRE_SET_TONE",
    "selectedTone": "FRIENDLY"
  }
}
```

In this example, we enabled chat history (so the AI can recall prior Q\&A for `user-12345`), and we injected custom context about *Acme DeFi* (company name/description and token info) and set the tone to a friendly preset. The assistant will incorporate all of that into its answer.

**Context Injection Fields**

When using `contextInjection`, you can provide any of the following fields to tailor the AI‚Äôs persona, knowledge base, or response style. All fields are optional ‚Äì include only what‚Äôs relevant to your use case. (If a field is omitted, the system will fall back to the default context configured for your API key, if any, or simply not use that aspect.)

* **`companyName`** (`string`): Name of your company, project, or organization. The assistant will refer to this name when appropriate, and ‚Äúspeak‚Äù as a representative of this entity.
* **`companyDescription`** (`string`): A brief description of the company or project. This can include what the project does, its mission, domain, or any key details. The assistant can draw on this description to answer questions about the project‚Äôs purpose or background.
* **`companyWebsiteUrl`** (`string` ‚Äì URL): The URL of the company/project‚Äôs website. The assistant might use this in answers (for example, providing the link to users asking for more info). Include the full URL with `https://`.
* **`whitePaperUrl`** (`string` ‚Äì URL): URL to the project‚Äôs whitepaper or documentation. If provided, the assistant may reference it or suggest reading it for detailed technical info.
* **`purpose`** (`string`): The role or purpose of the AI chatbot from your perspective. For example, *‚ÄúTo assist users with support questions about our DeFi platform‚Äù* or *‚ÄúTo educate users on our blockchain‚Äôs features.‚Äù* This helps the AI understand its intended role, which can influence how it frames responses.
* **`cryptoToken`** (`boolean`): Set to `true` if your project has a cryptocurrency token and you want the AI to be able to provide information about it. When true, you should also provide the relevant details in the `tokenInformation` field. If `false` (or omitted), the assistant won‚Äôt proactively inject token details (though it may still answer general token questions).
* **`tokenInformation`** (`object`): Details about your crypto token (relevant if `cryptoToken: true`). This object can include:
  * **`tokenName`** (`string`): The name of the token (e.g. `"ChainGPT Token"`).
  * **`tokenSymbol`** (`string`): The token‚Äôs symbol or ticker (e.g. `"CGPT"`). You can include a `$` or other prefix if commonly used.
  * **`tokenAddress`** (`string`): The blockchain contract address of the token (on its primary network). This helps the assistant confirm the token‚Äôs existence or reference the contract.
  * **`tokenSourceCode`** (`string`): The source code of the token‚Äôs smart contract, or a URL to the source code repository. This could be used if technical details about the contract are asked.
  * **`tokenAuditUrl`** (`string` ‚Äì URL): A link to any security audit report for the token‚Äôs contract (if available). This can be cited to reassure users about security.
  * **`explorerUrl`** (`string` ‚Äì URL): A link to a block explorer page for the token‚Äôs contract (for example, an Etherscan URL). Useful if users want to verify on-chain information.
  * **`cmcUrl`** (`string` ‚Äì URL): Link to the token‚Äôs page on CoinMarketCap, if applicable.
  * **`coingeckoUrl`** (`string` ‚Äì URL): Link to the token‚Äôs page on CoinGecko, if applicable.
  * **`blockchain`** (`array[string]`): A list of blockchain networks relevant to the token. For example, if the token is deployed on Ethereum and Polygon, you might set `"blockchain": ["ETHEREUM", "POLYGON"]`. This helps the AI contextualize which chain‚Äôs data or standards to consider. *Supported network values include:* `"ETHEREUM"`, `"BSC"` (Binance Smart Chain), `"ARBITRUM"`, `"BASE"`, `"BLAST"`, `"AVALANCHE"`, `"POLYGON"`, `"SCROLL"`, `"OPTIMISM"`, `"LINEA"`, `"ZKSYNC"`, `"POLYGON_ZKEVM"`, `"GNOSIS"`, `"FANTOM"`, `"MOONRIVER"`, `"MOONBEAM"`, `"BOBA"`, `"METIS"`, `"LISK"`, `"AURORA"`, `"SEI"`, `"IMMUTABLE_ZK"`, `"GRAVITY"`, `"TAIKO"`, `"CRONOS"`, `"FRAXTAL"`, `"ABSTRACT"`, `"WORLD_CHAIN"`, `"MANTLE"`, `"MODE"`, `"CELO"`, `"BERACHAIN"`. (Use all that apply; unrecognized values will be ignored.)
* **`socialMediaUrls`** (`array<object>`): A list of social media or community links for your project. Each element in the array should be an object with a **`name`** and a **`url`**. For example:

  ```
  "socialMediaUrls": [
      { "name": "twitter",   "url": "https://twitter.com/YourProject" },
      { "name": "telegram",  "url": "https://t.me/YourProjectChannel" },
      { "name": "website",   "url": "https://yourproject.org/blog" }
  ]
  ```

  Include the platforms relevant to your users (e.g. Twitter, Telegram, LinkedIn, YouTube, Medium, etc.). The assistant might use these to answer questions like ‚ÄúWhere can I follow your project updates?‚Äù by providing these links.
* **`limitation`** (`boolean`): A flag to enforce any special content limitations or strictness. By default this can be `false`. If `true`, it might indicate the assistant should be more cautious or avoid certain types of content (depending on how the backend interprets it). If `false`, the assistant just follows the general content guidelines and your provided context.
* **`aiTone`** (`string`): Controls the tone or style of the AI‚Äôs responses. Supported values are:
  * `"DEFAULT_TONE"` ‚Äì Use the default tone (if you have a default set in your API key‚Äôs configuration, or the system‚Äôs default neutral tone). In this mode, you **do not** need to specify `selectedTone` or `customTone`.
  * `"CUSTOM_TONE"` ‚Äì Define a completely custom tone in your own words. If you choose this, provide the desired style in the `customTone` field.
  * `"PRE_SET_TONE"` ‚Äì Use one of the predefined tone profiles. If you choose this, specify which preset tone with the `selectedTone` field.
* **`selectedTone`** (`string`): If `aiTone` is `"PRE_SET_TONE"`, use this field to pick the preset style you want. The ChainGPT assistant supports a range of preset tones. The value should be one of the following options:

  * **PROFESSIONAL**
  * **FRIENDLY**
  * **INFORMATIVE**
  * **FORMAL**
  * **CONVERSATIONAL**
  * **AUTHORITATIVE**
  * **PLAYFUL**
  * **INSPIRATIONAL**
  * **CONCISE**
  * **EMPATHETIC**
  * **ACADEMIC**
  * **NEUTRAL**
  * **SARCASTIC\_MEME\_STYLE**

  Choose the tone that best fits how you want the AI to sound. *(If **`aiTone`** is not **`"PRE_SET_TONE"`**, this field is ignored.)*
* **`customTone`** (`string`): If `aiTone` is `"CUSTOM_TONE"`, provide a brief description of the style or persona you want the AI to adopt. For example: *‚ÄúSpeak in a playful, casual manner using crypto slang‚Äù* or *‚ÄúRespond as a strict professor who uses technical language.‚Äù* The assistant will adjust its writing style according to this description. *(Ignored if **`aiTone`** is not **`"CUSTOM_TONE"`**.)*

Using context injection can powerfully customize the AI‚Äôs behavior and knowledge base on a per-request basis. However, you generally only need to include fields that differ from your default API key settings or that are relevant to the current query. Overloading the request with too much extraneous context might confuse the model, so provide **concise, relevant details** for the best results.

#### Response Format

If the request is successful, the API will return an HTTP 200 response. The structure of the response depends on whether you requested a full JSON or a stream:

* **Buffered (JSON) Response:** You will receive a JSON object once the AI has finished generating the answer. The typical response structure is:

  ```
  {
    "status": true,
    "message": "Chat response generated successfully.",
    "data": {
      "bot": "<assistant's answer text>"
    }
  }
  ```
* **Streaming Response:** The server will begin sending back the answer in chunks over the open HTTP connection. Each chunk is a piece of the answer text (e.g. a few words or a sentence). The response uses standard HTTP chunked transfer encoding. You should keep the connection open and read from it until the stream ends. There is no enclosing JSON object in this mode; instead, you‚Äôll receive raw text data progressively. Once the full answer has been sent, the server will terminate the stream (signaling the end of response).

In both cases, if an error occurs, you will receive an error status code and a JSON error message (except in some streaming error cases where the connection might drop). Common error responses:

* **400 Bad Request:** Missing or invalid fields in your request JSON.
* **401 Unauthorized:** API key missing or invalid.
* **402 Payment Required / 403 Forbidden:** Insufficient credits in your account (payment needed) or you are not allowed to access this resource.
* **404 Not Found:** Incorrect endpoint (e.g. using a non-existent route like `/chat` instead of `/chat/stream`).
* **429 Too Many Requests:** You‚Äôve hit a rate limit.
* **5xx Server Error:** An issue on the server side (rare).

Always check the response status and the JSON body. On errors, the JSON will typically look like:

```
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Error description here."
}
```

No `data` field will be present in error responses.

#### Credit Usage

Every API call consumes credits from your ChainGPT account:

* A basic request (no history) costs 0.5 **credits**.
* If `chatHistory` is `"on"`, the request costs 0.5 **credits** (0.5 base credit + 0.5 extra for the history storage/retrieval overhead).

Ensure your account has sufficient credits; otherwise, you will get an error (HTTP 402/403 indicating insufficient credits). You can top up and track credits in the ChainGPT web app dashboard. **Note:** Enabling conversation memory (history) incurs the extra credit charge because the system stores the conversation and uses it for context in future calls.

***

### Examples

Below are code examples demonstrating how to call the ChainGPT chat completion endpoint in different scenarios. These examples show both the default (buffered) usage and streaming usage, using Axios (Node.js) and cURL. You can adapt these to other HTTP clients or languages as needed.

#### Using Axios (Node.js) ‚Äì Full JSON Response

In this example, we send a question and get the complete answer in one response. We‚Äôll use Axios to make the POST request and simply log the returned answer. This is suitable for scenarios where you don't need real-time streaming updates.

```
import axios from 'axios';

async function getAnswer() {
  const API_URL = 'https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream';
  const API_KEY = process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY;  // Set your API key in an environment variable

  try {
    const response = await axios.post(API_URL, 
      {
        model: "general_assistant",
        question: "Explain the concept of AI",
        chatHistory: "off"
      },
      {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
      }
    );
    // The full response is now in response.data
    console.log("Assistant answer:", response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("API request failed:", error.response?.data || error.message);
  }
}

getAnswer();
```

**Explanation:** We set `chatHistory: "off"` to treat this as a single-turn query. The assistant‚Äôs answer is logged from `response.data`. In a real application, you might handle the JSON further (e.g. displaying the answer in a UI).

#### Using Axios (Node.js) ‚Äì Streaming Response

This example shows how to receive the answer as a stream using Axios. We configure Axios to expect a stream and then read chunks of data as they arrive, printing them out immediately. This creates an effect of the AI ‚Äútyping‚Äù the answer in real-time.

```
import axios from 'axios';

async function streamAnswer() {
  const API_URL = 'https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream';
  const API_KEY = process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY;

  // Create an Axios instance configured for streaming
  const apiClient = axios.create({
    baseURL: API_URL,
    timeout: 60000,
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` },
    responseType: "stream"
  });

  try {
    const response = await apiClient.post("/", {
      model: "general_assistant",
      question: "Give me the latest news about Ethereum.",
      chatHistory: "off"
    });
    const stream = response.data;  // This is a Node.js readable stream
    stream.on("data", (chunk) => {
      const textChunk = chunk.toString();
      process.stdout.write(textChunk);  // Output the chunk (could also append to a variable or UI element)
    });
    stream.on("end", () => {
      console.log("\n[Stream ended]");
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during streaming request:", error.response?.data || error.message);
  }
}

streamAnswer();
```

**Explanation:** Here we create a dedicated Axios instance with `responseType: "stream"`. The POST request is made to the baseURL `/` (which corresponds to the full `https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream`). As chunks of the answer come in, we convert them to string and write to standard output (this could be replaced with updating a web UI in a real app). When the stream ends, we log a message. This way, the answer is displayed gradually, as if the AI is responding in real time.

#### Using cURL ‚Äì Full Response (JSON)

You can test the API quickly with cURL. The following example makes a request for a complete response (non-streaming). cURL will wait for the response and then output it all at once:

```
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model": "general_assistant",
        "question": "Explain the concept of AI",
        "chatHistory": "off"
      }'
```

Make sure to insert your actual API key. This request asks the AI to explain AI, with no history. The response will be a JSON object containing the answer. For example, you might get:

```
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Chat response generated successfully.",
  "data": {
    "bot": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from data, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and understanding natural language. AI systems range from simple algorithms to complex neural networks and power applications like virtual assistants, recommendation engines, and autonomous vehicles."
  }
}
```

#### Using cURL ‚Äì Streaming Response

To see streaming in action via cURL, you can use the same endpoint. The response will stream to your terminal, printing partial results as the AI generates them:

```
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model": "general_assistant",
        "question": "Give me the latest news about Ethereum.",
        "chatHistory": "off"
      }' 
```

As the request runs, you should see the answer text start to appear in your terminal gradually. It may come in segments, and will complete when the curl command exits. If your terminal buffers the output and you don't see anything until the end, try running cURL with the `-N` / `--no-buffer` option to disable output buffering:

```
curl -N -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream" ... (rest of command)
```

This ensures you see each chunk as soon as it arrives.

***

Using this single REST endpoint, developers can integrate ChainGPT‚Äôs Web3-savvy AI into many environments ‚Äì from interactive chat interfaces that benefit from streaming, to batch scripts and backends that just need a quick JSON answer. The combination of **chat history** and **context injection** features allows you to build anything from persistent conversational agents to specialized Q\&A bots (for your documentation, DeFi app, NFT project, etc.), or even use the model for tasks like text summarization or classification with the proper prompt.&#x20;

By following this reference and using the provided examples as a starting point, you can seamlessly bring ChainGPT's capabilities into your application. Enjoy building with ChainGPT Web3 LLM, and refer to this guide whenever you need details on request format or features!


# SDK Reference

## ChainGPT Web3 AI Chatbot - SDK Reference

The ChainGPT Web3 AI Chatbot SDK is a Node.js library that provides convenient methods to integrate ChainGPT's AI chatbot capabilities into your application. It allows you to retrieve chatbot responses as a real-time stream or as a complete result, with support for custom context injection and other configuration options.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js installed and have obtained a ChainGPT API key with available credits from the [ChainGPT AI Hub](https://app.chaingpt.org/). You will need an active ChainGPT account with credits to use the SDK.
{% endhint %}

***

### Quickstart

Get started with a simple chatbot query. The example below shows how to install the package, initialize the SDK with your API key, and make a basic request for a chatbot response:

```
npm install @chaingpt/generalchat

# or 
yarn add @chaingpt/generalchat
```

```
import { GeneralChat } from '@chaingpt/generalchat';

const generalchat = new GeneralChat({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY', // replace with your actual API key
});

async function main() {
  const response = await generalchat.createChatBlob({
    question: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms',
    chatHistory: "off"  // set to "on" to enable saving chat history (optional)
  });
  console.log(response.data.bot);
}

main();
```

Running this code will print the chatbot's answer to the console. For a streaming response example, see the **Usage Patterns** section.

***

### Installation

To install the ChainGPT Web3 AI Chatbot SDK, use npm (or yarn) in your Node.js project:

```
npm install --save @chaingpt/generalchat
```

This will add the SDK to your project‚Äôs dependencies. Once installed, you can import the SDK in your code (ESM syntax is used as shown in the examples).

***

### Authentication & Credits

ChainGPT‚Äôs API uses API keys and a credit-based system for authentication. Before using the SDK, make sure you have:

* **API Key:** Generate a secret API key from the ChainGPT AI Hub (go to the API Dashboard on [app.chaingpt.org](https://app.chaingpt.org/) and use the *Create Secret Key* feature). Copy the generated key ‚Äì you'll use it to initialize the SDK.
* **Credits:** Ensure your ChainGPT account has sufficient credits. Each API call consumes credits (see **Rate Limits & Pricing** for details).

Initialize the SDK with your API key:

```
import { GeneralChat } from '@chaingpt/generalchat';

const generalchat = new GeneralChat({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY',
});
```

This API key will be used to authenticate all requests made through the `generalchat` instance.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** Treat your API key as a secret. Avoid hard-coding it in public code or repositories. Instead, store it in an environment variable or secure storage and pass it to the SDK (for example, `apiKey: process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY`). This prevents unauthorized use of your key.
{% endhint %}

***

### Configuration Options

The ChainGPT Web3 AI Chatbot SDK offers several configuration options to tailor the chatbot‚Äôs behavior and context. These options can be provided when making a chat request (and some are set during SDK initialization):

* **apiKey:** *(string, required)* Your ChainGPT API key (set when creating a `GeneralChat` instance).
* **question:** *(string, required)* The user prompt or question for the chatbot (provided in each request via `createChatStream` or `createChatBlob`).
* **chatHistory:** *(string, optional)* `"on"` or `"off"`. Enables or disables saving chat history for the request. When `"on"`, the conversation is recorded and can be retrieved later; when `"off"`, the conversation is not saved. Default is `"off"`.
* **useCustomContext:** *(boolean, optional)* If `true`, the chatbot will include custom context information associated with your API key (as configured in the ChainGPT AI Hub) in its response. If `false` or omitted, the chatbot uses only its default knowledge base.
* **contextInjection:** *(object, optional)* An object providing custom context data to override or supplement the default context from AI Hub. All fields in this object are optional; you can specify as much or as little context as needed. If `contextInjection` is provided (and `useCustomContext` is `true`), the SDK will use these values for this request instead of or in addition to the stored context on AI Hub. The available fields include:
  * `companyName` *(string)* ‚Äì Name of the company or project for the chatbot.
  * `companyDescription` *(string)* ‚Äì A brief description of the company/project.
  * `companyWebsiteUrl` *(string)* ‚Äì URL of the company‚Äôs website.
  * `whitePaperUrl` *(string)* ‚Äì URL of the project‚Äôs whitepaper or documentation.
  * `purpose` *(string)* ‚Äì The primary purpose or mission of the AI chatbot (or the company).
  * `cryptoToken` *(boolean)* ‚Äì Whether the company/project has an associated cryptocurrency token. If `true`, you can provide token details in `tokenInformation`.
  * `tokenInformation` *(object)* ‚Äì Details about the token (if `cryptoToken` is true):
    * `tokenName` *(string)* ‚Äì Name of the token.
    * `tokenSymbol` *(string)* ‚Äì Symbol or ticker of the token (e.g., `$CGPT`).
    * `tokenAddress` *(string)* ‚Äì Blockchain address of the token contract.
    * `tokenSourceCode` *(string)* ‚Äì Link or reference to the token‚Äôs source code.
    * `tokenAuditUrl` *(string)* ‚Äì Link to an audit report for the token.
    * `exploreUrl` *(string)* ‚Äì URL of a blockchain explorer for the token.
    * `cmcUrl` *(string)* ‚Äì CoinMarketCap URL for the token.
    * `coingeckoUrl` *(string)* ‚Äì CoinGecko URL for the token.
    * `blockchain` *(array)* ‚Äì List of blockchain networks where the token is deployed. Use values from the `BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK` enum. For example:

      ```
      blockchain: [
        BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK.ETHEREUM,
        BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK.POLYGON_ZKEVM
      ]
      ```

      **Supported blockchain enum values:** `ETHEREUM`, `BSC`, `ARBITRUM`, `BASE`, `BLAST`, `AVALANCHE`, `POLYGON`, `SCROLL`, `OPTIMISM`, `LINEA`, `ZKSYNC`, `POLYGON_ZKEVM`, `GNOSIS`, `FANTOM`, `MOONRIVER`, `MOONBEAM`, `BOBA`, `MODE`, `METIS`, `LISK`, `AURORA`, `SEI`, `IMMUTABLE_ZK`, `GRAVITY`, `TAIKO`, `CRONOS`, `FRAXTAL`, `ABSTRACT`, `CELO`, `WORLD_CHAIN`, `MANTLE`, `BERACHAIN`.
  * `socialMediaUrls` *(array)* ‚Äì A list of social media links relevant to the company or project. Each entry is an object with `name` and `url` keys, for example:

    ```
    socialMediaUrls: [
      { name: "LinkedIn", url: "https://www.linkedin.com/company/example" },
      { name: "Twitter",  url: "https://twitter.com/example" }
    ]
    ```
  * `limitation` *(boolean)* ‚Äì Whether there are any limitations or restrictions for the chatbot. (If `true`, the bot might be instructed to acknowledge or enforce certain limitations in responses. Defaults to `false` if not set.)
  * **AI Tone Configuration:** The SDK allows you to set the tone or style of the AI‚Äôs responses:
    * `aiTone` *(enum)* ‚Äì Determines how the tone is specified. Possible values from the `AI_TONE` enum:
      * `AI_TONE.DEFAULT_TONE` ‚Äì Use the default tone (no customTone or selectedTone needed).
      * `AI_TONE.CUSTOM_TONE` ‚Äì Use a custom tone; if chosen, provide a `customTone` string.
      * `AI_TONE.PRE_SET_TONE` ‚Äì Use one of the predefined tones; if chosen, provide a `selectedTone` value.
    * `selectedTone` *(enum value)* ‚Äì If `aiTone` is `PRE_SET_TONE`, specify which preset tone to use. Options include: `PROFESSIONAL`, `FRIENDLY`, `INFORMATIVE`, `FORMAL`, `CONVERSATIONAL`, `AUTHORITATIVE`, `PLAYFUL`, `INSPIRATIONAL`, `CONCISE`, `EMPATHETIC`, `ACADEMIC`, `NEUTRAL`, `SARCASTIC_MEME_STYLE`. (Use values from the `PRE_SET_TONES` enum.)
    * `customTone` *(string)* ‚Äì If `aiTone` is `CUSTOM_TONE`, provide a custom tone description in this string (e.g., `"Provide detailed security explanations."`).

Below is an example of a full `contextInjection` object utilizing many of these fields:

```
const contextInjection = {
  companyName: "Company name for AI chatbot",
  companyDescription: "Company description for AI chatbot",
  companyWebsiteUrl: "https://www.example.com",
  whitePaperUrl: "https://www.example.com/whitepaper.pdf",
  purpose: "Purpose of AI chatbot for this company.",
  cryptoToken: true,
  tokenInformation: {
    tokenName: "ExampleToken",
    tokenSymbol: "$EXM",
    tokenAddress: "0x1234...abcd",
    tokenSourceCode: "Source code reference or repository",
    tokenAuditUrl: "https://www.example.com/audit",
    exploreUrl: "https://explorer.example.com/token/0x1234...abcd",
    cmcUrl: "https://coinmarketcap.com/exampletoken",
    coingeckoUrl: "https://coingecko.com/exampletoken",
    blockchain: [ 
      BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK.ETHEREUM, 
      BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK.POLYGON_ZKEVM 
    ]
  },
  socialMediaUrls: [
    { name: "LinkedIn", url: "https://linkedin.com/company/example" }
  ],
  limitation: false,
  aiTone: AI_TONE.PRE_SET_TONE,
  selectedTone: PRE_SET_TONES.FRIENDLY,
  customTone: "Only for custom AI Tone"
};
```

You can pass this `contextInjection` object in a chat request to override or provide additional context. If a field is provided here, it will take precedence over the default context associated with your API key on the AI Hub for that request.

**Using Custom Context:** To use the custom context features, set `useCustomContext: true` in your request options. If you do not supply a `contextInjection` object when `useCustomContext` is true, the SDK will automatically fetch the default context (company details, etc.) associated with your API key from the AI Hub. If you do provide a `contextInjection` object, the SDK will use your provided values (overriding the defaults for those fields) for that request.

***

### Usage Patterns

Once the SDK is installed and configured, you can use it to send questions to the ChainGPT chatbot and receive answers. The SDK supports two modes of getting responses:

* **Streaming responses** ‚Äì where the answer is received in a stream of data chunks (useful for showing the AI's answer as it is generated, similar to a typing indicator).
* **Single (blob) responses** ‚Äì where the full answer is returned at once after processing.
* **Chat history management** ‚Äì optional feature to record and retrieve conversation history.

Below are examples of each usage pattern.

#### Streaming Responses

Use the `createChatStream` method to get a streaming response. This returns a Node.js readable stream. You can listen for `data` events to receive chunks of the answer and an `end` event when the answer is complete.

```
import { GeneralChat } from '@chaingpt/generalchat';

const generalchat = new GeneralChat({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY',
});

async function main() {
  const stream = await generalchat.createChatStream({
    question: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms',
    chatHistory: "off" // Set to "on" to save chat history; otherwise keep it "off"
  });
  stream.on('data', (chunk) => console.log(chunk.toString()));
  stream.on('end', () => console.log("Stream ended"));
}

main();
```

In this example, the question is sent and the answer will be printed to the console in real-time as the data arrives. The `chatHistory` parameter is set to `"off"`, meaning this conversation is not saved. (Use `"on"` if you want to enable history saving for this request.)

#### Single Response (Blob)

If you prefer to get the entire response at once (instead of streaming), use the `createChatBlob` method. This returns a promise that resolves to the full response data.

```
import { GeneralChat } from '@chaingpt/generalchat';

const generalchat = new GeneralChat({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY',
});

async function main() {
  const response = await generalchat.createChatBlob({
    question: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms',
    chatHistory: "off"
  });
  console.log(response.data.bot);
}

main();
```

Here, `response` will contain the chatbot‚Äôs answer once the promise resolves. The answer text is accessible as `response.data.bot`. This example also disables history saving. You can enable it by setting `chatHistory: "on"` similarly, and providing a unique ID as described below.

#### Chat History

The SDK can store chat history so you can retrieve past conversations. To use this feature, you must turn on history and provide a unique identifier for the conversation:

* Set `chatHistory: "on"` in the request options to enable saving.
* Provide an `sdkUniqueId` parameter (a unique identifier such as a UUID or user ID) to tag the conversation. This ensures the history is associated with a specific user or session.

**Saving history in a chat request:**

```
import { GeneralChat } from '@chaingpt/generalchat';

const generalchat = new GeneralChat({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY',
});

const uniqueUuid = "907208eb-0929-42c3-a372-c21934fbf44f"; // an example unique identifier

async function main() {
  const stream = await generalchat.createChatStream({
    question: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms',
    chatHistory: "on",            // enable history saving
    sdkUniqueId: uniqueUuid       // associate this request with a unique ID
  });
  stream.on('data', (chunk) => console.log(chunk.toString()));
  stream.on('end', () => console.log("Stream ended"));
}

main();
```

In the above example, the conversation (question and answer) will be stored on ChainGPT's servers under the provided `sdkUniqueId`. Using the same `sdkUniqueId` for subsequent requests allows the chatbot to continue the conversation context or simply to group all queries from the same user.

**Retrieving chat history:**

You can retrieve saved chat history using the `getChatHistory` method. By default, this will retrieve history entries associated with your API key. You can optionally filter by the `sdkUniqueId` if you want history for a specific user or session.

For example, to retrieve the 10 most recent history entries:

```
const response = await generalchat.getChatHistory({
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0,
  sortBy: "createdAt",
  sortOrder: "ASC"
});
console.log(response.data.rows);
```

This will fetch up to 10 chat history records (in ascending order by creation time). Each record in `response.data.rows` contains details of a past question and answer.

To retrieve history for a specific user/session, include the same `sdkUniqueId` used when saving:

```
const response = await generalchat.getChatHistory({
  sdkUniqueId: uniqueUuid,  // filter by a specific conversation ID
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0,
  sortBy: "createdAt",
  sortOrder: "ASC"
});
```

The above will return history entries only for the conversation identified by that `sdkUniqueId`.

***

### Error Handling

The SDK provides a custom error class to handle API errors gracefully. If the library fails to connect to the API, or if the API returns an error response (e.g., an HTTP 4xx or 5xx status), a `GeneralChatError` will be thrown.

You can catch this error and inspect its message as shown below:

```
import { GeneralChat, Errors } from '@chaingpt/generalchat';

const generalchat = new GeneralChat({ apiKey: 'YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY' });

async function main() {
  try {
    const stream = await generalchat.createChatStream({
      question: 'Explain quantum computing in simple terms',
      chatHistory: "off"
    });
    stream.on('data', (chunk) => console.log(chunk.toString()));
    stream.on('end', () => console.log("Stream ended"));
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Errors.GeneralChatError) {
      console.error("Chat SDK Error:", error.message);
    } else {
      console.error("Unexpected Error:", error);
    }
  }
}

main();
```

In this snippet, if an error occurs during the API call, the catch block checks if it‚Äôs a `GeneralChatError` (accessible via `Errors.GeneralChatError` from the package). You can then handle it accordingly (for example, logging the error message or alerting the user). Non-`GeneralChatError` exceptions are rethrown or handled separately as needed.

***

### Rate Limits & Pricing

Using the ChainGPT Web3 AI Chatbot API via the SDK is subject to credit costs and rate limiting:

* **Credit Deduction:** Each chat request (stream or blob) deducts 0.5\*\* credits\*\* from your ChainGPT account. If you enable the chat history feature (`chatHistory: "on"`), an **additional 0.5 credits** is deducted for that request (total 2 credits for that call). Ensure you have sufficient credits before making requests, or the API will refuse the call.
* **Rate Limits:** To prevent abuse, each API key is limited to **200 requests per minute**. If you exceed this rate (bursting more than 200 requests within a one-minute window), you may receive rate-limit errors or throttled responses. Design your application to respect this limit (for example, by queuing or delaying requests if necessary).

There are no additional fees beyond credit usage. Credits can be obtained or topped up through the ChainGPT platform (see the ChainGPT app for purchasing or earning credits). Always monitor your credit balance, especially if you have an application making a high volume of requests.

***

### Language Support & Environment

The ChainGPT General Chat SDK is written for **JavaScript/TypeScript** and is intended for use in a **Node.js** environment. Key points about compatibility:

* **Runtime:** Node.js (LTS versions are supported). The SDK is not intended to run in a browser environment.
* **Language:** The library is usable in both JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It comes with TypeScript type declarations, so you get type checking and IntelliSense if you use TypeScript or a code editor like VSCode.
* **Module Format:** Distributed as an NPM package. You can import it using ESM `import` syntax (as shown in examples). If using CommonJS, you may use `require('@chaingpt/generalchat')` as needed.

Ensure that your environment can make HTTPS requests (the SDK under the hood communicates with ChainGPT‚Äôs REST API) ‚Äì Node‚Äôs built-in `https` module is used by default.

***

### Security Considerations

When integrating the ChainGPT SDK, keep the following security best practices in mind:

* **API Key Protection:** Never expose your ChainGPT API key in client-side code or public repositories. Treat it like a password. Use environment variables or a secure key management system to supply the key to your application at runtime.
* **Authentication Enforcement:** The SDK requires a valid API key with credits, which helps ensure only authorized users (with your key) can use your ChainGPT allowance. If an unauthorized person obtains your key, they could consume your credits, so guard it carefully.
* **Request Limits:** The built-in rate limiting (200 requests/minute) and credit system serve as basic security to mitigate abuse (both for the API service and for your account to not accidentally overspend credits). Design your usage within these limits to avoid triggering protective measures.
* **Data Privacy:** If you enable chat history, conversation data is stored on ChainGPT servers. Consider your application‚Äôs privacy requirements ‚Äì avoid sending sensitive personal data in questions if that data should not be stored. All communication with ChainGPT servers is over HTTPS for encryption in transit.

By following these considerations, you can safely integrate the SDK into your application without compromising sensitive information.

# Unique Capabilities

## Unique Capabilities of the ChainGPT Web3 AI LLM

ChainGPT‚Äôs Web3 AI Large Language Model (LLM) is a blockchain-savvy AI designed to provide quick, accurate, and **up-to-date** information for Web3 use cases. It integrates **live on-chain data** (from blockchain networks) and **off-chain data** (from APIs, news, and social feeds) in real time, allowing it to answer questions with the latest information available. Developers can also **customize its knowledge** by injecting context or data at query time, tailoring the AI‚Äôs responses to their specific application needs. The result is a versatile model that feels like an expert crypto analyst, on-chain auditor, and market researcher all-in-one.

**Below we outline ChainGPT‚Äôs unique capabilities, grouped into key categories for easy scanning:**

***

### Market Research & Analysis

ChainGPT can generate real-time market insights and research reports across the crypto and stock markets:

* **Market Overview Reports:** Summarizes crypto or stock market performance for today, the past week, current month, or any other time frame ‚Äî including top movers, volume trends, and sentiment shifts.
* **Token & Asset Analysis:** Produces full reports on individual tokens or stocks, covering fundamentals, price history, technical metrics, holder data, and social signals. Can also analyze the entire market and get a high level overview.
* **Pump/Dump Diagnostics:** Explains sudden price movements by analyzing on-chain behavior, whale activity, sentiment spikes, or external news.
* **News Summaries:** Retrieves and summarizes relevant headlines and market-moving announcements across projects, tokens, or the broader ecosystem.

***

### Wallet & Address Intelligence

ChainGPT can analyze blockchain wallet addresses to provide rich insights:

* **Balances & Holdings:** Fetches current balances of tokens and assets for a given wallet across supported blockchains in real time. This includes native coin and token holdings, updating as the blockchain does.
* **DeFi Positions:** Identifies and summarizes a wallet‚Äôs active DeFi positions (e.g. liquidity pool stakes, loans, yield farming deposits) by checking on-chain protocols. It can tell what platforms a wallet is using and how much is staked or borrowed.
* **Profit/Loss Tracking:** Estimates profit and loss (PnL) for a wallet by examining transaction history and current asset prices. For example, the model can infer if a wallet‚Äôs holdings have increased or decreased in value over time, providing a high-level PnL analysis.
* **Transaction Analysis:** Reviews recent transactions of an address to highlight notable activities. It can detect patterns like large incoming/outgoing transfers, NFT purchases, or interactions with specific contracts, giving context to an address‚Äôs behavior.

***

### Token Metrics & Analysis

This LLM is equipped to retrieve and explain detailed token information and metrics:

* **Price History & ATH/ATL:** Provides price history and key metrics such as all-time high (ATH) and all-time low (ATL) values for cryptocurrencies. It can tell you, for instance, *‚ÄúToken X reached an ATH of $Y on Date Z.‚Äù* and compare current prices to historical peaks.
* **Tokenomics & Supply:** Explains tokenomics of a project, including total and circulating supply, inflation/emission rates, and distribution. If asked, it can summarize how a token is allocated (team, treasury, staking rewards, etc.) and whether the supply is deflationary or inflationary.
* **Unlock Schedules:** Retrieves upcoming token unlock events (e.g. vesting schedule milestones or cliff unlocks for investors/team tokens) for a given project. This helps developers or traders understand when significant increases in circulating supply might occur.
* **Technical Indicators:** Generates basic technical analysis insights like recent trading volume, market capitalization, or price momentum. It can integrate with market data feeds to report current market cap or 24h volume and even explain trends or patterns in plain language.

***

### On-Chain Analytics

ChainGPT‚Äôs model performs advanced on-chain data analysis to deliver insights usually requiring a blockchain analyst:

* **Whale Tracking:** Monitors and reports on large holders (‚Äúwhales‚Äù) and their activities. For example, you can ask if any big wallet is accumulating or selling a certain token, and the LLM can surface recent whale transactions or holdings changes by analyzing blockchain data.
* **Arbitrage & Market Opportunities:** Identifies price discrepancies or unusual patterns across exchanges and protocols. The model can hint at potential arbitrage opportunities (e.g. a token trading cheaper on DEX A vs DEX B) or detect when a token‚Äôs on-chain exchange reserves drop suddenly (which might indicate impending price moves).
* **Trending Narratives:** Tracks emerging on-chain trends or ‚Äúnarratives.‚Äù For instance, it might observe increased activity in a sector (like many new AI-related tokens launching, or a surge in Layer2 usage) and inform you of that narrative. It essentially synthesizes on-chain signals into plain-English takeaways about what themes are gaining traction.
* **Transaction Tracing:** Follows the flow of funds through multiple hops. If analyzing a complex transaction or series of transfers (for example, funds moving through mixers or bridges), the LLM can break down the path and provide an understandable summary of where assets came from and went on the blockchain.

***

### Social & Sentiment Insights

Beyond on-chain data, ChainGPT incorporates social and sentiment analysis to gauge the human side of the market:

* **KOL Tracking:** Monitors key opinion leaders (influential figures on crypto Twitter and other platforms) and summarizes their sentiments or mentions. You can ask what a prominent analyst or founder has been saying about a project, and the model can pull in recent relevant quotes or topics from that person‚Äôs posts.
* **Influencer & Community Sentiment:** Analyzes the overall sentiment of discussions around a token or topic. For example, it can summarize whether the community sentiment on a new protocol is bullish, bearish, or mixed, based on recent social media and forum content.
* **Trend Detection on Social Media:** Identifies which projects or themes are trending in social conversations. If a certain hashtag or token is suddenly gaining a lot of attention, ChainGPT will flag that as a trending topic, giving developers a heads-up on social momentum that might not yet be reflected on-chain.
* **News & Announcement Impact:** When notable news breaks (like an exchange listing or partnership), the model can contextualize the social reaction. It might report *‚ÄúProject X‚Äôs partnership announcement is trending positively on forums, with discussions focusing on its long-term value.‚Äù*

***

### NFT & ENS Intelligence

ChainGPT‚Äôs capabilities extend into NFTs and blockchain naming services, providing a rich understanding of these assets:

* **NFT Floor Prices & Stats:** Retrieves real-time floor prices and volume for NFT collections. You can inquire about the current floor price of a popular NFT collection (e.g. Bored Apes, CryptoPunks), and the model will provide the latest floor value and perhaps the 24h change or number of sales, by querying marketplace data.
* **Portfolio & Trait Analysis:** Summarizes a wallet‚Äôs NFT portfolio or evaluates specific NFTs. For instance, it can list all NFTs held by an address and their estimated values, or explain the rarity of a given NFT‚Äôs traits in a collection. This is done by cross-referencing NFT metadata and sales data.
* **ENS Lookups & Domain Info:** Performs Ethereum Name Service (ENS) lookups and reverse lookups. If given an ENS domain (e.g. `vitalik.eth`), ChainGPT can return the associated wallet address and any profile info. Conversely, given a wallet, it can check for an ENS name. It also understands ENS records, so it can tell if a domain has specific content or subdomains set.
* **NFT Market Trends:** Highlights trends in the NFT market, like which collections are gaining traction or if a particular artist‚Äôs work is rising in value. This involves monitoring NFT trade volumes and social buzz to inform users of emerging interest in certain digital collectibles.

***

### Regulatory, Market & Compliance Data

ChainGPT‚Äôs LLM stays up-to-date with the regulatory landscape and broader market news, which is crucial for enterprises and informed builders:

* **Real-Time News Summaries:** Integrates off-chain news feeds to provide concise summaries of the latest headlines in crypto. Ask about *‚Äútoday‚Äôs major crypto news‚Äù* and it can summarize things like ETF filings, exchange hacks, macroeconomic news affecting Bitcoin, or major protocol upgrades that broke in the last few hours.
* **Regulatory Updates:** Provides information on regulatory changes and compliance requirements across jurisdictions. For example, it can explain the status of EU‚Äôs MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation, recent SEC announcements or enforcement actions in the US, and other policy developments. The model keeps a knowledge base of these updates and can retrieve the latest known state or commentary on them.
* **Compliance & Risk Data:** Assists with compliance checks by cross-referencing known databases. It can, for instance, check if a given wallet appears on sanction lists or if a token might be considered a security by certain regulatory criteria (based on known guidance). It can also fetch data like current and historical ETF proposals, listing their approval status or rejections.
* **Market Indexes & Indicators:** Beyond news, it can report on market health indicators (fear & greed index, total market cap, BTC dominance, etc.) and explain what they mean. This gives a high-level context of the market environment from a compliance or institutional perspective (e.g. how traditional finance sentiment or legislation news is affecting crypto market indexes).

***

### Developer Utilities and Tools Integration

Built with developers in mind, ChainGPT‚Äôs LLM can plug into development workflows and tools, making it more than just a Q\&A model:

* **Blockchain RPC Access:** The model can directly query blockchain node RPCs to fetch live data on demand. Developers can ask the LLM to execute a read operation (e.g., *‚ÄúCall this smart contract function to get the current staking pool size‚Äù*) and the model will perform the call and return the result. This on-the-fly RPC integration means the AI‚Äôs answers can include fresh data from on-chain that wasn‚Äôt pre-trained.
* **Smart Contract Auditing:** It can perform a security analysis of smart contract code supplied in the prompt. By leveraging its training on common vulnerabilities and known patterns, ChainGPT‚Äôs LLM will review Solidity (or other language) code and highlight potential bugs or security issues. This acts like an AI auditor, explaining in natural language where a function might be misused or how a known exploit could apply.
* **Code Generation & Snippets:** Given an objective, the LLM can generate code snippets or API calls to help developers. For example, it can produce a sample web3.js or ethers.js code block to interact with a contract, or even a complete small Solidity contract for a described use-case. This speeds up development by allowing the AI to draft boilerplate code that a developer can refine.
* **Live Price Feeds & Math:** The model can pull in real-time price feeds for tokens and perform calculations. So a developer could ask for the current price of ETH in USD and EUR, or request a conversion of Token X holdings to USD value, and get an answer based on the latest price data. This is facilitated by integrations with price oracles and market APIs, meaning the answer reflects the price at query time.
* **API & SDK Integration:** ChainGPT‚Äôs LLM is accessible via API/SDK, and it‚Äôs built to integrate into applications seamlessly. While not a direct ‚Äúcapability‚Äù of the model‚Äôs output, it means developers can easily plug all the above capabilities into their platforms ‚Äì from chatbots in wallets, to analytics dashboards, to compliance tools ‚Äì with enterprise-grade scalability and data privacy (no need to send data to a third-party LLM that isn‚Äôt Web3-aware).

***

### Autonomous Agents & Real-Time Action

ChainGPT‚Äôs AI can go beyond single responses ‚Äì it can operate as an **autonomous agent**, continuously handling tasks and reacting to real-time events:

* **Always-On Monitoring:** The LLM can be the brain of an agent that watches on-chain events or market conditions 24/7. For example, you could set up an agent to monitor mempool transactions or liquidity pool changes; the AI can interpret these events in real time and decide if an action or alert is warranted. This always-on capability means important events can trigger immediate AI analysis without waiting for human queries.
* **Multi-Step Task Execution:** Using an agent framework, ChainGPT can perform multi-step operations on its own. It can plan and execute a sequence of actions such as detecting an arbitrage opportunity, then retrieving price data from multiple DEXs, and finally outputting an arbitrage strategy or even generating a transaction payload to exploit the price difference. All steps are decided by the AI agent autonomously, guided by the goals set by the developer.
* **On-Chain Operations:** Uniquely, this AI can be empowered to interact with smart contracts and on-chain protocols directly (with appropriate safeguards). That means an agent powered by ChainGPT could not only identify something (like *‚Äúliquidity is low in Pool X, causing a price premium‚Äù*), but also suggest and prepare an on-chain operation (like *‚Äúexecute a trade or rebalance liquidity‚Äù*). Developers remain in control of what actions are permitted, but the AI can generate the transaction data or call needed to perform the operation.
* **Integration with Agent Frameworks:** ChainGPT provides the tooling (such as an AI Virtual Machine and agent SDKs) to deploy these autonomous agents in Web3 environments. Agents can run on social platforms (e.g. a Twitter bot that replies with analyses instantly) or within decentralized applications. They combine the natural language understanding of the LLM with programmatic tool use (reading/writing blockchain data, calling APIs), effectively bridging complex blockchain data and everyday user interaction.
* **Real-Time Learning and Adaptation:** While the core model is static, an agent can be configured to incorporate new information as it arrives. For instance, an AI agent could continuously ingest new blocks, pending transactions, or incoming news, and update its internal context. This approach means the agent ‚Äúlearns‚Äù from live data stream in a bounded way, staying current throughout its operation. It ensures truly real-time responses, not just on a per-question basis but as an ongoing process.

***

### Real-Time Data Integration Architecture

A key differentiator of ChainGPT‚Äôs LLM is **how it pulls in live data**. Unlike ordinary language models that rely solely on static training data, ChainGPT‚Äôs infrastructure ties the model into a network of data sources at query time:

* **On-Chain Data Feeds:** ChainGPT connects to blockchain nodes and indexers for multiple chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and others). When a question requires on-chain information ‚Äì such as a wallet balance or latest block details ‚Äì the system fetches that data live via RPC or subgraph queries and feeds it into the model‚Äôs context. This happens behind the scenes, so the model‚Äôs answer already includes the up-to-the-second on-chain facts.
* **Off-Chain APIs and Knowledge Bases:** The model is augmented with access to off-chain data like market prices, news articles, and social media content. For example, it uses crypto market APIs for price and volume, news feeds/RSS for headlines, and can even use web scraping or integrated databases for things like token metadata. These sources are queried in real time as needed. The retrieved information is then incorporated into the model‚Äôs response generation, ensuring answers reflect the latest available data.
* **Tool-Driven Query Resolution:** Under the hood, ChainGPT‚Äôs LLM uses a tool-driven approach: it can recognize when a query requires external data and trigger the appropriate ‚Äútool‚Äù (like a balance lookup tool, price feed tool, or web search tool). By dynamically injecting the live results into the prompt, the model effectively has an expanded knowledge beyond its training cutoff. This architecture lets it handle questions like *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the current price of token ABC?‚Äù* or *‚ÄúGive me the latest transaction of address XYZ‚Äù* with factual correctness, where a normal LLM would be blind.
* **Consistent Data Refresh:** The integration isn‚Äôt one-off ‚Äì for ongoing sessions or agent tasks, the system can refresh data periodically. If you keep a conversation going, asking follow-ups like *‚ÄúNow what‚Äôs the price?‚Äù* 5 minutes later, the model will fetch new data again. This real-time loop ensures that even in multi-turn conversations or continuous agent operations, ChainGPT‚Äôs intelligence remains aligned with reality in that moment.

***

### Custom Context Injection for Tailored Responses

Another powerful feature for developers is the ability to **inject custom context** into ChainGPT‚Äôs LLM, allowing fine-tuned control and domain specificity without retraining the model:

* **Domain-Specific Data Injection:** Developers can provide additional information or data in their API calls to ChainGPT. For instance, a trading platform might inject a user‚Äôs portfolio holdings and trade history into the prompt when asking the LLM to analyze the user‚Äôs performance. The LLM will then incorporate that context in its answer (e.g. referring to the user‚Äôs specific assets or past trades) even though such private data isn‚Äôt part of the base model.
* **Extended Knowledge Base:** If you have proprietary knowledge (say, an internal database of blockchain addresses tagged with labels, or detailed documentation of a private smart contract), you can feed relevant portions into the prompt. ChainGPT‚Äôs model will treat this injected text as context, meaning it can answer questions about that data as if it ‚Äúknows‚Äù it. This is similar to retrieval-augmented generation: the model‚Äôs effective knowledge extends to whatever you supply at query time.
* **Instruction and Tone Customization:** Through system messages or context instructions, developers can also steer the LLM‚Äôs style and role. For example, you can inject a system prompt that says ‚ÄúYou are an expert compliance assistant, respond with reference to policy XYZ.‚Äù The model will then follow that guidance, giving responses aligned with the provided context or persona. This helps in adapting the single model to many roles ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs a helpful tutor for novices or a terse analytical engine for experts ‚Äì depending on the surrounding context.
* **No Fine-Tuning Required:** This context injection approach means you don‚Äôt have to fine-tune or train a custom model to get customized behavior. By simply prepending documents or data excerpts to the user‚Äôs query, the ChainGPT LLM can effectively answer with awareness of that information. Developers benefit by quickly prototyping solutions (for example, integrating the AI with their application‚Äôs database or user data) without the cost or time of training a new model. The model‚Äôs large context window supports substantial injected data, enabling non-trivial knowledge bases to be attached on the fly.
* **Use Cases of Contextual Customization:** For instance, an enterprise could use context injection to ensure the AI knows the company‚Äôs internal compliance rules when answering how to handle a certain crypto asset. Or a wallet app could inject the user‚Äôs recent transactions so that when the user asks ‚ÄúHow did I perform this month?‚Äù, the AI has the raw data to calculate and explain the result. This flexibility to blend ChainGPT‚Äôs broad built-in knowledge with your own data is a core differentiator for specialized applications.

### Summary: Empowering Web3 Builders with a Specialized AI

ChainGPT‚Äôs Web3 AI LLM brings together a wide array of capabilities under one roof ‚Äì from deep on-chain analytics and token metrics to social sentiment and regulatory intelligence ‚Äì all powered by live data integration. Its modular design allows **real-time knowledge** retrieval and **contextual customization**, meaning it stays current and can be tailored to specific needs without retraining.

In practice, these unique capabilities make ChainGPT a **differentiated tool for Web3 builders**: developers and product teams can rely on a single AI assistant to handle tasks that would normally require many separate tools or experts. Whether it‚Äôs auditing a smart contract, tracking a whale wallet, fetching the latest NFT prices, or parsing a new regulatory report, ChainGPT‚Äôs LLM does it in a developer-friendly manner with natural language outputs. This enables faster development of crypto applications, more informed decision-making, and innovative user experiences ‚Äì all backed by an AI that truly understands the crypto ecosystem in real time.


# AI NFT Generator (API & SDK)

## ChainGPT AI NFT Generator (API & SDK) Overview

ChainGPT‚Äôs **AI NFT Generator** is a full-stack API and SDK for creating, minting, and managing NFTs through AI. It‚Äôs the first solution to combine AI-driven image generation with on-chain NFT minting in one platform, so developers can go from an idea to a blockchain asset seamlessly. With a single integration, you can generate unique images from text prompts, convert them into NFT metadata, and mint them on multiple blockchains ‚Äì all without needing separate AI models or smart contract code‚Äã. This empowers developers, product teams, and Web3 projects to launch NFT features faster, using ChainGPT‚Äôs infrastructure to handle the heavy lifting.

***

### Key Use Cases

* **Single NFT Generation:** Create one-off AI-generated NFTs on demand. For example, users in a game or app can input a prompt to instantly get a custom NFT avatar or digital collectible. The API returns the generated image and token data, ready to mint or display.
* **Full Collection Creation:** Generate entire NFT collections (up to 10,000 images) in one go‚Äã. The AI can produce large sets of art with variation, which you can mint as a series (e.g. generative profile picture collections). This dramatically speeds up launching an NFT project ‚Äì what used to take weeks of manual design can happen in under a minute.
* **Integrated Minting:** Every image comes with **mint-ready** metadata. You can directly mint the AI-generated art as an NFT on the chosen blockchain via the API/SDK, without writing custom smart contracts. The service handles token creation, storage of the image/metadata, and linking it all on-chain.
* **Metadata Control:** Developers retain control over NFT metadata. By default the system generates standard metadata (e.g. name, description, traits) for each NFT, but you can override or post-edit attributes as needed. This is useful for injecting project-specific traits or ensuring metadata consistency across a collection.
* **Multi-Chain Deployment:** Easily deploy NFTs across **multiple blockchains** from the same API. The AI NFT Generator supports **BNB Chain (BSC)** and **opBNB**, **Ethereum**, **Polygon**, **Arbitrum One**, **Avalanche**, **Cronos**, **Tron**, **Base**, and many more ‚Äì over 25 networks in total‚Äã. You can specify a target chain ID for each mint, enabling cross-chain NFT support without additional tools.

### How It Works

<div align="left"><figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2FmM40nlohBCYgD9rEUUrN%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c011b555-9b02-405b-808a-527350a8c43a" alt="" width="403"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

{% hint style="info" %}
***High-level workflow:** the AI NFT Generator handles everything from prompt to minting.*
{% endhint %}

The process starts with a **text prompt** provided by the developer or user, describing the desired artwork. The AI model then generates an **image** based on this prompt (using advanced text-to-image algorithms). Next, the system creates an NFT **metadata** JSON for the image ‚Äì including details like title, description, and any traits, plus a link to the image file. With one API call, the platform mints a new **NFT token** on the specified blockchain, attaching the generated image and metadata to it. Finally, your NFT collection can be added to your wallet and used as you wish! All these steps are orchestrated behind a single API/SDK interface, so you don‚Äôt need to manage them separately.

### Integration Options: API vs SDK

ChainGPT offers both a RESTful API and a client SDK, so you can choose the integration path that fits your stack:

* **REST API:** Integrate via HTTP endpoints accessible in any language or platform. This option is ideal if you want direct control or are working in a backend environment outside of Node.js. You send requests with the prompt, parameters, and target chain, and receive the generated image/metadata or transaction details in JSON responses. (If you only need image generation without minting, a lightweight **text-to-image** API endpoint is available as well.) See the **API Reference** for full endpoint details and examples.

[api-reference](/chaingpt-v1-docs/dev-docs-b2b-saas-api-and-sdk/ai-nft-generator-api-and-sdk/api-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK:** Use ChainGPT‚Äôs official SDK package for Node.js projects. The SDK provides convenient methods that wrap the API calls ‚Äì for example, `generateImage()` or `generateNft()` ‚Äì abstracting away raw HTTP calls and handling tasks like file I/O. It‚Äôs well-suited for frontend web apps, Node backends, or scripts, and includes TypeScript type definitions for safer development. The SDK simplifies common workflows (such as queuing batch jobs or tracking generation progress) with one-line function calls. Refer to the **SDK Reference** for installation and code snippets.

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
*(Both the API and SDK require an API key for authentication. You can obtain this key from the ChainGPT* [*developer dashboard*](https://app.chaingpt.org/apidashboard) *‚Äì see ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù below.)*
{% endhint %}

***

### Supported Blockchains

One of the AI NFT Generator‚Äôs strengths is broad **multichain support**. Out of the box, you can mint NFTs on a wide range of networks without any custom setup. Supported chains include:

* **Ethereum** ‚Äì Mainnet and testnets
* **Binance Chain (BNB)** ‚Äì and **opBNB** layer 2
* **Polygon** (Ethereum sidechain)
* **Arbitrum One** and other L2s
* **Avalanche**, **Cronos**, **Hedera**, **Immutable X**
* **Tron**, **Mantle**, **CoreDAO**, **Linea**
* **Base**, **Scroll**, **Skale**, **5ire**, and more...

In total, 25+ blockchain networks are integrated. The API/SDK uses a simple `chainId` parameter to select the target network, so switching the mint destination (or offering a choice to your users) is straightforward. ChainGPT handles the low-level differences between chains, providing a unified NFT minting experience across ecosystems.

***

### Unique Capabilities

ChainGPT‚Äôs AI NFT Generator comes with several powerful features that distinguish it from basic image APIs:

* **Prompt Enhancement & Suggestions:** To help improve results, the platform includes an ‚Äú**Enhance Prompt**‚Äù option that refines your input text for a better image output. There‚Äôs also a ‚ÄúSurprise Me‚Äù feature that suggests random creative prompts, which can inspire users or generate diverse outputs without extra input. These tools lower the barrier for non-artists to get high-quality NFTs.
* **Batch Queueing for Collections:** When generating large collections, you can use the **queue** system to process images asynchronously. Rather than waiting on one NFT at a time, the SDK allows queuing up generation tasks (e.g. `generateNftWithQueue()` in the SDK) so you can request hundreds or thousands of images in parallel‚Äãfile-leehq5gwmzjy2dqf8wha2q. The API provides methods to check generation progress and retrieve results when ready, enabling scalable NFT creation workflows.
* **Flexible Image Output Settings:** You have control over the size and aspect ratio of generated images. The generator supports multiple aspect ratios (e.g. 1:1 square, 3:2 rectangle, etc.) and custom dimensions up to high resolutions‚Äã. It also offers built-in **upscaling** options (1√ó or 2√ó) to enhance image resolution after generation. This flexibility means you can tailor the output to your platform‚Äôs requirements (thumbnail vs. high-res print, etc.).
* **Multiple AI Art Models:** The service provides a selection of AI models/styles to generate art in different aesthetics. For example, you might choose a *Realistic* model for photorealistic art, an *Anime* model for cartoon-style NFTs, a *3D Render* model for game assets, or others like *Drawing* or *Pixel Art*. By selecting the model best suited to your use case, you can maintain a consistent style across your NFTs or offer users a choice of artistic styles.
* **Advanced Collection Generation:** Beyond single images, the AI NFT Generator can automate trait assignment and rarity for generative collections. You can supply base assets or let the AI create variations, and the system will combine traits to produce unique NFTs with rarity distribution‚Äã. This is particularly useful for profile-picture (PFP) projects that involve layering attributes (hats, glasses, backgrounds, etc.) across thousands of NFTs. The heavy lifting of randomizing traits and ensuring each NFT is one-of-a-kind is handled for you.

***

### Developer-Friendly Design

The AI NFT Generator API & SDK are built with developers in mind, focusing on quick integration and robust performance:

* **Fast & Efficient:** Generation and minting are optimized for low latency. In typical cases, an NFT (image + on-chain mint) can be produced in **30‚Äì60 seconds**. Even bulk operations use parallel processing and queueing to finish quickly. This speed lets you integrate on-demand NFT creation in real time applications (like letting a user design an NFT and mint it during a sign-up flow) without long waits.
* **No AI/ML Expertise Needed:** You don‚Äôt have to train models or manage machine learning pipelines. ChainGPT‚Äôs models are pre-trained and continuously improved by the team, so you simply leverage them via API. There‚Äôs no need for you to gather datasets, run GPU servers, or tweak neural network parameters ‚Äì the service delivers great results out-of-the-box.
* **Customizable Outputs:** While the default settings work for most cases, developers can fine-tune the generation process through parameters. You can adjust the diffusion **steps** (to control image refinement), toggle **enhancements**, select different generator **models**, and set image dimensions. The output NFTs can thus be customized to fit your application‚Äôs style and quality requirements.
* **Straightforward Onboarding:** Getting started is simple. Just obtain an API key from ChainGPT‚Äôs developer portal and you can begin calling the API or SDK immediately (no complex setup). The SDK can be installed with a single npm/yarn command and comes with clear documentation. Both the REST API and SDK use an intuitive request structure. For example, to generate an NFT you provide the prompt, choose a model, and specify a wallet address & chain ‚Äì the response returns the image data or a mint transaction. Detailed guides and code examples are available in the docs to accelerate your integration.

# QuickStart Guide

## ChainGPT AI NFT Generator QuickStart Guide

This QuickStart walks you through generating AI images and minting NFTs using ChainGPT‚Äôs API and SDK ‚Äî with real examples, valid parameters, and everything you need to go live fast.

***

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following in place:

* **ChainGPT API Key:** Sign up on the ChainGPT platform and obtain an API key from the API dashboard. Every request must include this key in the Authorization header (as a Bearer token). Also ensure your account has sufficient **credits** (see *Pricing & Credits* below) ‚Äì requests will fail if you run out of credits.
* **Node.js Environment:** Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for using the SDK). You‚Äôll also need a package manager like npm or Yarn.
* **API Access Tool:** For making raw API calls, you can use cURL (as shown in examples) or any HTTP client (Postman, etc.). All API endpoints are relative to the base URL `https://api.chaingpt.org`.
* **Secure Key Storage:** Treat your API key like a password ‚Äì store it securely (for example, in environment variables or a secrets manager), **not** hard-coded in your code or pushed to repositories.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Make sure your ChainGPT account has sufficient credits or an appropriate plan. NFT generation calls will fail if you run out of credits or if your API key is invalid.
{% endhint %}

***

### Using the REST API (via cURL)

ChainGPT‚Äôs AI NFT Generator API allows you to generate AI images from text and optionally mint them as NFTs. Below we demonstrate the workflow using direct REST calls with cURL.

#### 1. Generate an AI Image (Synchronous)

To **generate an image** from a text prompt, use the `POST /nft/generate-image` endpoint. This returns the image data directly in the response, suitable for quick previews or standalone image generation.

**Request:** Include your API key in the header and provide the prompt and generation parameters in JSON. For example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/generate-image" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "prompt": "A majestic dragon under a sunset sky",
           "model": "velogen",
           "steps": 3,
           "height": 512,
           "width": 512,
           "enhance": "1x"
         }'
```

In this request:

* `prompt` ‚Äì The text description of the image to generate.
* `model` ‚Äì The AI model to use (e.g. `"velogen"`, `"nebula_forge_xl"`, `"VisionaryForge"`, or `"Dale3"` for DALL¬∑E 3).
* `steps` ‚Äì *(Optional)* Number of refinement steps. Higher values can yield more detail but take longer. Each model has a range: **velogen** supports 1‚Äì4 steps (default 2), **nebula\_forge\_xl** and **VisionaryForge** support up to 50 (default 25), while **Dale3** (DALL¬∑E 3) doesn‚Äôt use a steps parameter.
* `height` and `width` ‚Äì The image dimensions in pixels. Ensure they are within the supported range for the chosen model (see **Model Options** below). Common base sizes are 512 or 768 for quick generation, or 1024 if supported.
* `enhance` ‚Äì *(Optional)* Upscaling option for higher resolution. Use `"1x"` for 1√ó enhancement or `"2x"` for 2√ó enhancement. If omitted or set to `"original"`, the image is generated at base resolution (no upscale). Using enhancement produces a larger image (up to the model‚Äôs max upscale) at additional credit cost.

**Response:** On success, you‚Äôll get a JSON response with the image data. For example:

```json
{
  "data": [ 255, 216, 237, ... ]
}
```

The `data` field is an array of bytes representing the generated image (in this case, a JPEG). You can convert this to an image file. For instance, in Node.js you could do:

```
fs.writeFileSync("output.jpg", Buffer.from(response.data));
```

This will write the bytes to `output.jpg`. (If the API returns a base64 string instead, decode it accordingly.)

**Model Options & Parameters:** The API supports multiple models, each with different capabilities:

* **velogen** ‚Äì Fast generation for smaller images. Supports base resolutions up to \~768px and 1‚Äì4 steps (quick iterations).
* **nebula\_forge\_xl** ‚Äì High-quality model for larger images (up to 1024px) and more steps (up to 50 for fine detail).
* **VisionaryForge** ‚Äì Similar to Nebula Forge XL (up to 1024px, 50 steps), with its own style/profile.
* **Dale3** ‚Äì Integration of OpenAI‚Äôs DALL¬∑E 3 model. Fixed 1024√ó1024 output, no custom steps or enhancements allowed. Use this for DALL¬∑E‚Äôs unique output, but note it has a separate pricing structure (see below).

Each model has recommended resolution ranges. For example, **velogen** is optimal at 512‚Äì768px (can upscale to \~1920px with `enhance: "2x"`), whereas **Nebula/VisionaryForge** excel at 768‚Äì1024px (up to \~1536px with upscale). If you request a resolution beyond a model‚Äôs base capability without setting `enhance`, the API may automatically upscale it if possible. It‚Äôs best to explicitly use the `enhance` parameter if you want high resolution output.

#### 2. Queue an NFT Image Generation (Asynchronous)

If you intend to **mint the image as an NFT**, it‚Äôs recommended to use the queued generation endpoint. This allows the backend to handle longer-running jobs and prepare NFT metadata. Use `POST /nft/generate-nft-queue` to start the generation without waiting for the image immediately.

**Request:** In addition to the prompt and image settings, you must provide:

* `walletAddress` ‚Äì The blockchain wallet address that will ultimately receive/own the NFT.
* `chainId` ‚Äì The identifier of the blockchain network where the NFT will be minted. (Use the **Get Chains** endpoint or see below for how to find supported chain IDs.)

Example cURL to queue a generation:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/generate-nft-queue" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "walletAddress": "0xABC123...DEF",
           "prompt": "Futuristic city skyline at night, neon glow",
           "model": "nebula_forge_xl",
           "steps": 25,
           "height": 1024,
           "width": 1024,
           "enhance": "2x",
           "amount":1,
           "chainId": 56
         }'
```

This request queues an image generation with the given parameters (prompt, model, etc.) on BSC Mainnet (`chainId`: 56). Higher values for `steps` (like 25 or even 50 for Nebula) can yield very detailed images, and here we used `enhance: "2x"` for an upscaled 1024‚Üí1536px output.

**Response:** The server immediately returns a job identifier:

```json
{
  "collectionId": "b8f86f05-5e8a-4f21-8c4a-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

The `collectionId` is a unique UUID for this generation task. The `status` will initially be `"queued"` (or `"processing"` shortly after) ‚Äì no image is returned yet. You will use this ID to query the generation status and later to mint the NFT.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If you **only** need an image (no NFT minting), you can skip the queue and use the direct `generate-image` endpoint (as in step 1). The queued endpoint is designed for NFT workflows, where you‚Äôll track progress and eventually call minting endpoints.
{% endhint %}

#### 3. Check Generation Progress

After queueing an NFT generation, you can poll its status using `GET /nft/progress/{collectionId}`. This returns the current status and (if completed) the result of the generation.

For example:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/progress/b8f86f05-5e8a-4f21-8c4a-xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Response:** If the job is still in progress, you‚Äôll see something like:

```json
{
  "collectionId": "b8f86f05-5e8a-4f21-8c4a-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": 45
}
```

Here, `status` is `"processing"` and `progress` is \~45%. (Some jobs may not return a percentage, just a status.) When the status becomes `"completed"`, the response will include the image data:

```json
{
  "statusCode":200,
   "message":"Request Successful",
   "data":{"images":["https://ipfs..../..1.png"],
   "generated":true}
}
```

In the above completed example, `data` contains the bytes of the generated image (starting with `137 80 78 71` which is the PNG file signature). You can now save or utilize this image (just as in step 1).

Often, instead of manually retrieving the raw image here, the next step is to call the minting API to get the NFT metadata. The image is stored on the backend once generation completes. For simplicity, you can proceed directly to **Mint the NFT** after you see a `"completed"` status.

> **Tip:** You don‚Äôt have to query progress in a tight loop. Polling every few seconds is sufficient. Alternatively, you could implement a webhook/callback if the API provided one, but polling is straightforward for most use cases.

#### 4. (Optional) Enhance a Text Prompt

If you have a short or less-detailed prompt and want to improve it **before** generating an image, you can use `POST /nft/enhancePrompt`. This endpoint uses AI to refine your prompt (making it more descriptive or creative), which can lead to better image outcomes.

For example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/enhancePrompt" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "prompt": "a futuristic city"
         }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "enhancedPrompt": "A sprawling futuristic cityscape at night, illuminated by neon lights and flying vehicles, with towering skyscrapers and advanced technology."
}
```

The API returns an `enhancedPrompt` field containing a more detailed version of your input. You can then take this suggestion and use it as the `prompt` in your next `generate-image` or `generate-nft-queue` call. Each prompt enhancement call costs a small number of credits (0.5 credits per call).

*(Using prompt enhancement is optional but recommended if you‚Äôre not getting the desired detail in the outputs. It can help maximize the quality of the image, especially for expensive models or high-step generations.)*

#### 5. Retrieve Supported Blockchains (Get Chains)

The AI NFT Generator supports minting on multiple blockchain networks. To see which `chainId` values you can use, call `GET /nft/get-chains`:

```bash
# Fetch mainnet chains only
curl -X GET "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/get-chains?testNet=false" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

By default, this returns only mainnets. Add `?testNet=true` to include test networks. A sample response:

```json
{
  "chains": [
    { "chainId": 56, "name": "BSC Mainnet", "network": "mainnet" },
    { "chainId": 1,  "name": "Ethereum",   "network": "mainnet" },
    { "chainId": 97, "name": "BSC Testnet","network": "testnet" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Each entry has a `chainId` and name. Use these IDs in the generation and minting calls. For example, `56` for Binance Smart Chain, `1` for Ethereum, `137` for Polygon, etc. If you‚Äôre testing on a testnet (like BSC Testnet or Goerli), be sure to both use the testnet `chainId` **and** a wallet address from that test network.

#### 6. Mint the NFT (Finalize Metadata & Minting)

Once your image is generated (and you have a `collectionId` from the queued generation), the final step is to **mint the NFT**. This involves calling `POST /nft/mint-nft` with the `collectionId` and some NFT metadata. This call will prepare the NFT‚Äôs metadata (and potentially trigger the on-chain mint, depending on the setup).

**Request:** Provide:

* `collectionId` ‚Äì The ID from the completed generation job (ensure the status was ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù before minting).
* `name` ‚Äì A name/title for the NFT (e.g. `"Neon Skyline City"`).
* `description` ‚Äì A description for the NFT, detailing the artwork or any info you want in the token metadata.
* `symbol` ‚Äì A short symbol or ticker for the NFT/collection (e.g. `"NEON"`).
* `ids` -  An array of ID lists, where each ID corresponds to a token minted from the collections.

Example cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/mint-nft" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "collectionId": "b8f86f05-5e8a-4f21-8c4a-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
           "name": "Neon Skyline City",
           "description": "A futuristic city skyline at night, generated by AI.",
           "symbol": "NEON",
           "ids":[1,.....n]
         }'
```

**Response:** If successful, you will receive metadata about the newly created NFT. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "Neon Skyline City",
  "description": "A futuristic city skyline at night, generated by AI.",
  "image": "ipfs://Qm...abcd",
  "attributes": [ /* ... */ ],
  "collectionId": "b8f86f05-5e8a-4f21-8c4a-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "transaction": null
}
```

This includes the `name`, `description` you provided, and importantly an `image` URL (often an IPFS link to the image that was uploaded). Additional metadata like `attributes` could appear if relevant. The `transaction` field may contain a transaction hash if the system initiated an on-chain mint for you, or `null` if not applicable.

At this point, the NFT‚Äôs data is ready. If the service did not automatically mint the NFT on-chain, you have two options to finalize the minting:

* Use the ChainGPT NFT contract to mint the token to the provided wallet address (you'll need on-chain interaction, see **Contract ABI** below).
* Or, if `transaction` was returned, wait for that transaction to confirm on-chain (or fetch it via a blockchain explorer).

In most cases, you will need to perform the actual blockchain transaction yourself. The `mint-nft` response gives you the metadata (and the image is now pinned e.g. on IPFS). Now you or your backend can call the blockchain smart contract‚Äôs `mint` function to create the NFT.

#### 7. (Optional) Get the NFT Contract ABI

If you plan to interact with the NFT smart contract directly (to manually call the `mint` function, or to integrate with web3 tooling), you can fetch the contract‚Äôs ABI via `GET /nft/abi`. This returns the ABI (Application Binary Interface) JSON of the ChainGPT NFT Mint Factory contract.

Example:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/abi" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "abi": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "name": "mint",
      "inputs": [
        { "name": "to", "type": "address" },
        { "name": "tokenURI", "type": "string" }
      ],
      "outputs": [ ... ]
    },
    {
      "type": "event",
      "name": "NFTMinted",
      "inputs": [ ... ]
    }
    // ... other functions and events ...
  ]
}
```

This ABI JSON can be used with a web3 library (Ethers.js, Web3.py, etc.) to invoke the contract. Typically, the NFT contract has a `mint(address to, string tokenURI)` function you‚Äôll call, passing the `walletAddress` and a token URI (which the backend has likely already created for you, pointing to the metadata JSON). The ABI also defines events like `NFTMinted` that you could listen for.

Using the ABI from the API ensures you‚Äôre interacting with the correct contract and function signature. After calling `mint-nft` (Step 6), you would use this ABI along with the `collectionId`/metadata info to execute an on-chain transaction to actually mint the NFT to the user‚Äôs wallet.

***

### Using the Node.js SDK (@chaingpt/nft)

ChainGPT provides an official JavaScript/TypeScript SDK (`@chaingpt/nft` on npm) to simplify integration. This SDK wraps all the above API calls into convenient functions. In this section, we‚Äôll accomplish the same tasks using Node.js.

#### 1. Installation and Setup

First, install the SDK into your Node.js project:

```bash
npm install --save @chaingpt/nft
# or
yarn add @chaingpt/nft
```

Import and initialize the SDK in your code with your API key:

```javascript
const { Nft } = require('@chaingpt/nft');  // import the SDK class
// import * as fs from 'fs';               // Node.js file system, if needed for saving files

const nft = new Nft({
  apiKey: process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY  // your ChainGPT API Key
});
```

Here we store the API key in an environment variable for safety (you can replace `process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY` with your key string for testing, but avoid hardcoding secrets in production). The `Nft` class instance `nft` will be used to call all NFT API methods.

#### 2. Generate an Image using the SDK

To generate an image, use the `nft.generateImage()` method. This mirrors the `POST /nft/generate-image` endpoint.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

async function quickGenerateImage() {
  try {
    const imageResult = await nft.generateImage({
      prompt: "A majestic dragon under a sunset sky",
      model: "velogen",
      steps: 2,
      height: 512,
      width: 512,
      enhance: "1x"
    });
    // The response contains the image data buffer.
    // Save it to a file:
    fs.writeFileSync("generated-image.jpg", Buffer.from(imageResult.data.data));
    console.log("Image saved to generated-image.jpg");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Image generation failed:", error);
  }
}

quickGenerateImage();
```

A few notes on the above code:

* The parameters `prompt`, `model`, `steps`, `height`, `width`, `enhance` are the same as described in the REST API section and are passed in as an object. The values here will produce a 512√ó512 image using the **velogen** model with 2 refinement steps and a 1√ó enhancement (effectively upscaled from 256px base to 512px output, since velogen‚Äôs base resolution is smaller).
* `imageResult` will be an object containing the image data. Typically, the SDK returns a structure similar to the API‚Äôs JSON. In this case, `imageResult.data.data` is the byte array of the image (the double `.data` is because the SDK may wrap the response). We convert it to a Buffer and write to a file.
* Error handling: we wrap the call in a try/catch to catch any exceptions (network issues, invalid parameters, etc.).

This method is synchronous from the caller‚Äôs perspective (it `await`s the image generation to complete and returns the image). Use this for quick generation or when you need the image immediately.

**Model options and parameters** (as discussed earlier) apply here as well. For example, you could switch `model` to `"nebula_forge_xl"` and increase `steps` to 25 for a higher-quality image (just ensure to adjust `height`/`width` within that model‚Äôs range, e.g. 1024√ó1024, and consider using `enhance: "2x"` for maximum quality). The SDK will call the appropriate API and retrieve the result.

#### 3. Get Supported Chains (Networks)

You can retrieve the list of supported blockchains via the SDK using `nft.getChains()`. By default, `getChains()` returns mainnets; pass `true` to include testnets.

```javascript
async function listChains() {
  const chainsMainnet = await nft.getChains();        // same as getChains(false)
  const chainsIncludingTest = await nft.getChains(true);
  console.log("Mainnet chains:", chainsMainnet.data);
  console.log("All chains (with testnets):", chainsIncludingTest.data);
}
```

This will fetch the same data as the `/nft/get-chains` API. Each call returns an object containing a `chains` array (accessible via `.data` in the SDK response). For example, `chainsMainnet.data.chains` might include entries like `{ chainId: 56, name: 'BSC Mainnet', ... }`. Use these IDs for the `chainId` parameter in generation and minting.

#### 4. Generate an NFT (Image + Metadata) using the SDK

To generate an image *with the intent to mint it as an NFT*, you have two options in the SDK:

* **Immediate generation** with `nft.generateNft()`: This will **wait** for the image generation to complete and return the image data plus a `collectionId`. Use this if your application can afford to wait (e.g. 30-60 seconds) for the generation to finish in one go.
* **Queued generation** with `nft.generateNftWithQueue()`: This will return immediately with a `collectionId` (similar to the REST `generate-nft-queue`), and you can then poll progress with `nft.getNftProgress()` if needed. Use this if you want to handle the waiting or progress feedback in your app manually (for example, show a progress bar).

For simplicity, here‚Äôs how to use `generateNft()` for a synchronous flow:

```javascript
async function generateAndPrepareNFT() {
  try {
    const result = await nft.generateNft({
      prompt: "Futuristic city skyline at night, neon glow",
      model: "nebula_forge_xl",
      steps: 25,
      height: 1024,
      width: 1024,
      enhance: "2x",
      walletAddress: "0xABC123...DEF",
      chainId: 97,  // BSC Testnet for example
      amount:1
    });
    console.log("NFT generation completed. Collection ID:", result.data.collectionId);
    // The image data is also available in result.data (similar to generateImage).
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("NFT generation failed:", error);
  }
}
```

This call will take some time to resolve (it internally queues the generation and waits for completion). Once it returns, you get an object `result` containing the image data and a `collectionId`. We log the `collectionId` for reference. At this point, the image is generated and stored, and you can proceed to mint it.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** We used `chainId: 97` (BSC Testnet) above for testing. In production, you might use a mainnet chain like 56 for BSC or 1 for Ethereum, etc. Ensure the `walletAddress` is compatible with the chain.
{% endhint %}

If instead you prefer to not block execution, you could use `generateNftWithQueue()`:

```javascript
const queueResult = await nft.generateNftWithQueue({ ...params });
console.log("Queued Collection ID:", queueResult.data.collectionId);
```

This returns immediately with the `collectionId`. You can then call `nft.getNftProgress({ collectionId })` in intervals to check `status` and `progress`, similar to the REST polling in step 3. The usage of `getNftProgress` is straightforward:

```javascript
const progressRes = await nft.getNftProgress({ collectionId: queueResult.data.collectionId });
console.log(progressRes.data);
```

It will output the status (`"queued"`, `"processing"`, or `"completed"`) and progress percent if available. Once completed, you could retrieve the image (though if you plan to immediately mint, you might skip directly retrieving the raw image and just call `mintNft` as shown next).

#### 5. Enhance a Prompt via SDK (Optional)

To use the prompt enhancement feature through the SDK, call `nft.enhancePrompt()`:

```javascript
async function enhanceMyPrompt() {
  const res = await nft.enhancePrompt({ prompt: "a futuristic city" });
  console.log("Enhanced prompt:", res.data.enhancedPrompt);
}
```

This will return an object whose `data.enhancedPrompt` is the improved prompt text (just like the REST response). You can then use that string in `generateImage` or `generateNft` calls to potentially get better results. Each call costs \~0.5 credits.

#### 6. Mint the NFT (using the SDK)

After generating the NFT (and obtaining a `collectionId`), use the SDK‚Äôs `nft.mintNft()` method to retrieve the minting details and finalize the NFT.

```javascript
async function mintGeneratedNFT(collectionId) {
  try {
    const mintRes = await nft.mintNft({
      collectionId: collectionId,
      name: "Neon Skyline City",
      description: "A futuristic city skyline at night, generated by AI.",
      symbol: "NEON",
      ids:[1,....,n]
    });
    console.log("Mint response:", mintRes.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Minting failed:", error);
  }
}
```

In this snippet, replace `collectionId` with the ID from the generation step (e.g. `result.data.collectionId` from `generateNft()` earlier). The `mintNft` call requires the same three metadata fields: `name`, `description`, `symbol`. On success, `mintRes.data` will contain the NFT metadata and possibly a transaction reference, similar to the REST response. You should see the `image` URL (likely an IPFS link) and the `collectionId` echoed back. If the SDK/backend initiated an on-chain mint, a transaction hash might be present in the data; if not, you‚Äôll use the ABI to mint manually.

After this, the NFT‚Äôs metadata is on-chain or ready to be minted on-chain. If no auto-mint happened, the next step would be using a blockchain library to call the actual smart contract‚Äôs mint function, as described below.

#### 7. Get the NFT Contract ABI (SDK)

You can fetch the NFT contract‚Äôs ABI via the SDK as well with `nft.abi()`:

```javascript
async function getContractABI() {
  const abiRes = await nft.abi();
  console.log("Contract ABI:", abiRes.data);
}
```

This returns the same JSON ABI that the REST call would. You can use this output in your web3 interactions. For example, with Ethers.js you might do:

```javascript
const contractAddress = "<ChainGPT_NFT_Contract_Address_For_Selected_Chain>";
const abi = abiRes.data.abi;
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(<RPC_URL>);
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(<PRIVATE_KEY>, provider);
const nftContract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer);
await nftContract.mint(walletAddress, tokenURI);
```

Where `tokenURI` is the metadata URL (e.g. the IPFS link) you got from `mintNft()`. The exact contract address to use would be provided by ChainGPT‚Äôs documentation for each chain (or possibly returned in the mint response or available in the `getChains` data if a new contract is deployed per chain).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** *The above blockchain interaction is just an illustration; the QuickStart‚Äôs scope is primarily the ChainGPT API/SDK usage. In practice, consult ChainGPT docs on whether a new contract is deployed or a shared factory contract is used across chains, and how the **`tokenURI`** is structured.*
{% endhint %}

### Pricing & Credit Usage

ChainGPT‚Äôs NFT Generator API uses a credit system. Each API call deducts credits from your balance, so you should understand the costs:

* **Standard image generation (ChainGPT models):** Using models like `velogen`, `nebula_forge_xl`, or `VisionaryForge` costs **1 credit per image** at base resolution. If you use enhancement (`"1x"` or `"2x"`), it costs **2 credits per image** (effectively +1 credit for the upscale). For example, generating a 1024√ó1024 image with Nebula Forge XL will cost 1 credit, and if you set `enhance: "1x"` (HD upscale), it will cost 2 credits.
* **DALL¬∑E 3 model (Dale3):** This third-party model has higher costs. Generating a 1024√ó1024 image with DALL¬∑E 3 uses about **4.75 credits** (standard quality). Using HD upscale on it roughly doubles the cost to **\~9.5 credits**. For other resolutions (since DALL¬∑E can only output 1024√ó1024 internally, the service resizes if you ask for non-1024 dimensions), the cost is about **9.5 credits** (standard) or **\~14.25 credits** with HD. In short, DALL¬∑E 3 is significantly more expensive per image.
* **Prompt Enhancement:** Each call to the `/nft/enhancePrompt` endpoint costs **0.5 credits** (since it‚Äôs a lighter-weight operation).
* **Minting calls and others:** Calling `mint-nft` or `get-chains` does not typically deduct credits (they mostly prepare data or fetch info). The main costs are for image generation and prompt enhancement.

Make sure you have enough credits for the operations you plan to run. For example, a single `generateNft` with Nebula (no enhance) will use 1 credit, plus a `mintNft` call (0 credits) ‚Äì total 1 credit. The same with DALL¬∑E 3 might use \~4.75 credits. If you plan to generate many images or use upscale frequently, ensure your credit balance is topped up accordingly.

{% hint style="info" %}
*Refer to the official pricing page for the latest credit costs and any changes to the model pricing structure.*
{% endhint %}

***

### Error Handling

Both the REST API and SDK provide error information to help you diagnose issues:

* **HTTP Status Codes:** The REST API returns standard codes. A `200 OK` indicates success (image or job created). **`400 Bad Request`** means something was wrong with your request (e.g., missing required field or invalid parameter value). For instance, if you exceed a model‚Äôs resolution limits, you might get a 400 with an error message like `{"error": "height and width exceed allowed resolution for model velogen"}`. **`401 Unauthorized`** means your API key is missing/invalid, or you‚Äôve run out of credits ‚Äì check that you included the correct Bearer token and have sufficient credits. **`429 Too Many Requests`** indicates you hit a rate limit or tried to use the API with no credits (the service may also treat no-credit attempts as a form of rate limit). **`500 Internal Server Error`** is a rare server-side issue ‚Äì you can retry after a delay or contact support if it persists. The error responses typically include a JSON body with an `"error"` message explaining what went wrong.
* **SDK Exceptions:** In the Node.js SDK, errors from the API are thrown as exceptions. Specifically, they will be instances of the `Errors.NftError` class if they originate from a non-200 API response. You should wrap SDK calls in `try/catch`. For example:

  ```javascript
  const { Errors } = require('@chaingpt/nft');
  try {
    const response = await nft.generateImage({ ... });
    // use response
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof Errors.NftError) {
      console.error("ChainGPT API Error:", err.message);
    } else {
      console.error("Unexpected Error:", err);
    }
  }
  ```

  This way you can distinguish ChainGPT API errors (e.g., invalid input, no credits, etc., conveyed in `err.message`) from other runtime errors. The SDK‚Äôs error message will usually match the JSON error from the HTTP response.
* **Debugging Tips:** Ensure that all required parameters are provided (the SDK‚Äôs TypeScript definitions can help catch missing fields). If you get a 401, double-check the API key. If an image generation is failing consistently, try the enhancePrompt to improve your prompt, or reduce the resolution/steps in case it‚Äôs hitting limits. On rate limits (429), implement a backoff/retry after the suggested time.

# API Reference

## ChainGPT AI NFT Generator API Reference

### Introduction

This reference describes the RESTful API endpoints for the ChainGPT AI NFT Generator. It covers endpoints for generating AI-based images and NFTs, along with supporting endpoints for prompt enhancement, chain information, and contract ABI. Each endpoint is documented with its method, path, required headers, parameters, and example requests/responses. Use this guide to integrate AI image generation and NFT minting into your applications.

***

### Authentication & API Basics

* **Base URL:** All endpoints are relative to the base URL `https://api.chaingpt.org`.
* **API Key (Authentication):** Every request must include your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token. For example:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
  ```

  You can obtain an API key from the ChainGPT web app‚Äôs API dashboard (after acquiring credits). Ensure the API key has sufficient credits in your account (see Pricing & Credits). Requests without a valid key will be rejected with **401 Unauthorized**.
* **Content Type:** Use `Content-Type: application/json` for request bodies, and expect JSON responses. Image data is returned encoded in JSON (e.g. as an array of bytes or base64 string).
* **Models:** The AI NFT Generator supports multiple image models. When generating images, you must specify one of the supported models: `"velogen"`, `"nebula_forge_xl"`, `"VisionaryForge"`, or `"Dale3"` (which uses OpenAI‚Äôs DALL¬∑E 3). Each model has specific constraints on image resolution and steps (see Supported Models & Parameters). Choose the model appropriate for your needs (e.g. *VeloGen* for quick small images, *NebulaForge XL* or *VisionaryForge* for high quality larger images, or *DALL¬∑E 3* for its unique generative capabilities).

***

### Text-to-Image Generation (Synchronous)

Use this endpoint to **generate an image from a text prompt** and get the result immediately. The API will return the image data (as a binary buffer or encoded string) in the response synchronously. This is ideal for quick image generation (e.g. previews or single images) when you don't need NFT minting.

#### `POST /nft/generate-image`

**Description:** Generates an image based on the given prompt and model. The image bytes are returned directly in the response (no need to poll for results). For supported models, resolutions, and steps, see the Supported Models & Parameters section.

**Headers:**

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required)
* `Content-Type: application/json` (required)

**Request Body Parameters:**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="113.9140625"></th><th width="158.32421875"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Parameter</strong></td><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><code>prompt</code></td><td>string (required)</td><td>The text prompt describing the image to generate.</td></tr><tr><td><code>model</code></td><td>string (required)</td><td>Identifier of the model to use (e.g. <code>"velogen"</code>, <code>"nebula_forge_xl"</code>, <code>"VisionaryForge"</code>, or <code>"Dale3"</code> for DALL¬∑E 3).</td></tr><tr><td><code>steps</code></td><td>integer (optional)</td><td>Number of refinement passes for image generation. Higher values can yield more detailed images at the cost of longer generation time. Each model supports a range: for example, <em>velogen</em> supports 1‚Äì4 steps (default ~2), while <em>NebulaForge XL</em> and <em>VisionaryForge</em> support up to 50 (default ~25). If not provided, a model-specific default is used.</td></tr><tr><td><code>height</code></td><td>integer (required)</td><td>Output image height in pixels. Must be within the model‚Äôs supported base resolution range (see Supported Models &#x26; Parameters). Common values are 512 or 768 for base generation, or larger if using enhancement.</td></tr><tr><td><code>width</code></td><td>integer (required)</td><td>Output image width in pixels. Must meet the same constraints as <code>height</code>. (For a square image, use equal width and height, e.g. 512√ó512 or 1024√ó1024.)</td></tr><tr><td><code>enhance</code></td><td>string (optional)</td><td>Upscaling option to improve image quality. Allowed values: <code>"original"</code> (no enhancement), <code>"1x"</code> (single enhancement), or <code>"2x"</code> (double enhancement). If omitted or set to <code>"original"</code>, the image is generated at base resolution. Using <code>"1x"</code> or <code>"2x"</code> will upscale the image (up to the model‚Äôs enhanced max resolution, e.g. ~1280px or 1920px) at additional credit cost (see Pricing &#x26; Credits).</td></tr><tr><td>style</td><td>string (optional)</td><td>If you include a style, the image will be generated according to the specified style. Available styles are listed below. (<a href="https://docs.chaingpt.org/dev-docs-b2b-saas-api-and-sdk/ai-nft-generator-api-and-sdk/quickstart-guide#supported-styles">Listed Styles</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>traits</td><td>Array (optional)</td><td>Traits are an optional array of objects. If provided, images will be generated based on the specified trait ratios. For example, if the array includes two traits‚Äî<code>Background</code> with values <code>Heaven</code> (ratio: 20) and <code>Hell</code> (ratio: 60)‚Äîand you request 5 images, approximately 1 will use <code>Heaven</code> and 3 will use <code>Hell</code> background.You can adjust traits and ratios to guide image generation accordingly.</td></tr><tr><td>image</td><td>Url (optional)</td><td>If you are using image-to-image, include the image URL in your API request with the key <code>image</code>.</td></tr><tr><td>isCharacterPreserve</td><td>Bool (optional)</td><td>Tells the generator to <strong>preserve the main character‚Äôs identity and features</strong> from the reference image (<code>image</code> URL) while still applying the <code>prompt.</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

**Sample Request:**

```bash
 curl -X POST https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/generate-image \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "dragon",
    "model": "velogen",
    "enhance": "original",
    "steps": 3,
    "height": 512,
    "width": 512,
    "style": "cinematic",
    "traits": [
      {
        "trait_type": "Background",
        "value": [
          { "value": "Heaven", "ratio": 20 },
          { "value": "Hell", "ratio": 60 },
          { "value": "garden", "ratio": 20 }
        ]
      },
      {
        "trait_type": "contrast",
        "value": [
          { "value": "dark", "ratio": 20 },
          { "value": "light", "ratio": 80 }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Sample Response:**

```json
{
  "data": [255, 216, 237, ...]
}
```

The response‚Äôs `data` field contains the raw image bytes. For example, the above byte array begins with `255, 216, 237, ...`, which corresponds to the JPEG file header. To use the image, you can write these bytes to a file or decode them in your application. For instance, in Node.js you could do:

```
fs.writeFileSync("output.jpg", Buffer.from(response.data.data));
```

This will save the returned image buffer to an `output.jpg` file. (If the API returns image data as a base64-encoded string instead, you would decode it accordingly.)

***

### Text-to-NFT Generation (Asynchronous)

Use these endpoints to **generate an image intended for NFT minting**. The generation is handled asynchronously: first you queue a generation job, then poll for its progress, and finally retrieve the NFT metadata for minting. This flow is suited for higher resolution images or cases where you plan to mint the result as an NFT on a blockchain.

#### `POST /nft/generate-nft-queue`

**Description:** Initiates an NFT image generation job with the specified parameters, associating it with a blockchain and wallet for eventual minting. Unlike the immediate image endpoint, this returns quickly with a job identifier (`collectionId`) while the image is generated in the background. You should subsequently use the progress endpoint to check when the image is ready. This queued approach is recommended for longer-running jobs or when an on-chain mint will follow.

**Headers:**

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required)
* `Content-Type: application/json` (required)

**Request Body Parameters:**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="152.6015625"></th><th width="152.33203125"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Parameter</strong></td><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><code>walletAddress</code></td><td>string (required)</td><td>The blockchain wallet address that will own the minted NFT. This should be a valid address on the target chain (e.g. the user‚Äôs wallet).</td></tr><tr><td><code>prompt</code></td><td>string (required)</td><td>The text prompt for image generation (same usage as in the direct image endpoint).</td></tr><tr><td><code>model</code></td><td>string (required)</td><td>The model to use (e.g. <code>"velogen"</code>, <code>"nebula_forge_xl"</code>, <code>"VisionaryForge"</code>, <code>"Dale3"</code>). Supports the same options and constraints as the direct image generation endpoint.</td></tr><tr><td><code>steps</code></td><td>integer (optional)</td><td>Number of generation steps (refinement passes). Defaults to the model‚Äôs optimal value if not provided. You may use higher values (up to the model‚Äôs max, e.g. 50 for NebulaForge XL/VisionaryForge) to improve quality.</td></tr><tr><td><code>height</code></td><td>integer (required)</td><td>Desired image height in pixels. Must be within the model‚Äôs allowed range (e.g. up to 1024 for base generation on NebulaForge XL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>width</code></td><td>integer (required)</td><td>Desired image width in pixels. Must be within the allowed range for the model (same constraints as height).</td></tr><tr><td><code>enhance</code></td><td>string (optional)</td><td>Enhancement/upscaling option (<code>"original"</code> (default),  <code>"1x"</code> or <code>"2x"</code>) for higher resolution output. If provided, the image will be upscaled up to the model‚Äôs enhanced max resolution. If omitted, the image is generated at base resolution. (Using enhancement will consume additional credits).</td></tr><tr><td><code>chainId</code></td><td>integer (required)</td><td>Blockchain network ID where the NFT will be minted. Use the <code>/nft/get-chains</code> endpoint to see supported chains and their IDs. For example: <code>1</code> for Ethereum, <code>56</code> for BSC Mainnet, <code>97</code> for BSC Testnet, etc..</td></tr><tr><td>amount</td><td>number (required)</td><td>Number of NFTs to be created in the collection</td></tr><tr><td>style</td><td>string (optional)</td><td>If you include a style, the image will be generated according to the specified style.

**Sample Response (Queued):**

```json
{
  "collectionId": "b8f86f05-5e8a-4f21-8c4a-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

On success, the API returns a unique `collectionId` for the requested generation, along with an initial `status` (typically `"queued"` or `"processing"`). No image data is returned at this stage. You must use the `collectionId` with the Progress endpoint (described next) to poll for completion and retrieve the image or metadata once the generation is finished.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Use the NFT queue endpoint (with `walletAddress` and `chainId`) if you plan to **mint the result as an NFT on-chain**. If you only need an image and do not intend to mint it, use the direct `POST /nft/generate-image` endpoint instead. The underlying image generation is similar, but the queued flow enables tracking progress and later minting.
{% endhint %}

**Track Generation Progress - GET /progress/{collectionId}**

**Description:** Checks the status and progress of a queued NFT generation job identified by its `collectionId`. Use this endpoint to poll for completion when you have initiated a job via `generate-nft-queue`. It returns whether the job is still processing or completed (and may include the result when done).

**Path Parameter:h**

* `{collectionId}` (string, required) ‚Äì The ID of the NFT generation job, as returned by the `generate-nft-queue` call.

**Headers:**

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required)
* *(No request body, this is a GET request.)*

**Sample Request:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/progress/b8f86f05-5e8a-4f21-8c4a-xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Sample Response (In Progress):**

```json
{
  "collectionId": "b8f86f05-5e8a-4f21-8c4a-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": 45
}
```

In the above example, the generation job is 45% complete (`"progress": 45`). The `status` could be `"queued"`, `"processing"`, or `"completed"`, etc., and `progress` may be a percentage or other indicator of completion. Not all jobs will report a numeric progress ‚Äì some may only update the status.

**Sample Response (Completed):**

```json
{
  "statusCode":200,
   "message":"Request Successful",
   "data":{"images":["https://ipfs..../..1.png"],
   "generated":true}
}
```

Once the job status is `"completed"`, the response may include the generated image data (similar format as the direct generate-image endpoint). In the example above, the `data` array contains bytes of a PNG image (`137 80 78 71` ... are the signature bytes of a PNG file). You can then retrieve or save this image data as needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** In many cases, you might not need to manually grab the raw image from the progress response. Instead, you would proceed to the minting step to get the final NFT metadata. The backend typically stores the generated image and prepares metadata when the job completes. The Progress endpoint is primarily for status updates; the final image and metadata are obtained via the minting endpoint next.
{% endhint %}

**NFT Mint Configuration/ metadata - POST /mint-nft**

**Description:** Finalizes the NFT creation by generating the metadata and preparing for minting. You call this after an image generation job is completed to get the NFT‚Äôs metadata (name, description, image URI, etc.) needed for on-chain minting. Think of this as retrieving the ‚Äúmint package‚Äù for your NFT. **Note:** This endpoint does **not** perform the actual blockchain mint transaction itself; it returns the data that you or the ChainGPT service will use to mint the NFT on-chain.

**Headers:**

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required)
* `Content-Type: application/json` (required)

**Request Body Parameters:**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="148.484375"></th><th width="153.08984375"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Parameter</strong></td><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><code>collectionId</code></td><td>string (required)</td><td>The ID of the completed generation job you want to mint, as returned by <code>generate-nft-queue</code>. Ensure that the generation status is <code>"completed"</code> before calling this (you can check via the progress endpoint).</td></tr><tr><td><code>name</code></td><td>string (required)</td><td>The desired name of the NFT. This will be stored in the token metadata as the title of the artwork.</td></tr><tr><td><code>description</code></td><td>string (required)</td><td>A description for the NFT. This text can describe the artwork or provide context, and will be included in the metadata.</td></tr><tr><td><code>symbol</code></td><td>string (required)</td><td>A short symbol or ticker for the NFT (or the collection). For example, <code>"DRAGON"</code> or <code>"CGPT"</code>. This may be used as an identifier for the NFT collection or simply stored as part of the metadata.</td></tr><tr><td>ids</td><td>array (required)</td><td>An array of ID lists, where each ID corresponds to a token minted from the collections.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Sample Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/mint-nft" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "collectionId": "b8f86f05-5e8a-4f21-8c4a-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
           "name": "Neon Skyline City",
           "description": "A futuristic city skyline at night, generated by AI.",
           "symbol": "NEON",
           "ids":[1,....,n]
         }'
```

**Sample Response:**

```json
{
  "name": "Neon Skyline City",
  "description": "A futuristic city skyline at night, generated by AI.",
  "image": "ipfs://Qm...abcd",
  "attributes": [ /* ... if any attributes ... */ ],
  "collectionId": "b8f86f05-5e8a-4f21-8c4a-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "transaction": null
}
```

The response typically returns a JSON object representing the NFT metadata. In the example above, the response echoes the `name` and `description` you provided, an `image` field (in this case an IPFS URI pointing to the generated image), and possibly an `attributes` array if any attributes were added. The `collectionId` is included again for reference. A `transaction` field may also appear ‚Äì for example, if the system automatically initiated an on-chain mint, this might contain a transaction hash; if not (as in this example), it may be `null`.

**Next Steps:** Once you have the NFT metadata (especially the `image` URI and the metadata JSON URI if provided), you can proceed to mint the NFT on the blockchain. If ChainGPT‚Äôs service handles the minting for you, it might provide a transaction or update to indicate the NFT was minted. Otherwise, you can use the returned data along with the provided smart contract ABI and chain information to perform the mint. Typically, you would use a web3 library and call the contract‚Äôs `mint` function, providing the target wallet address (the same `walletAddress` used earlier) and a tokenURI that points to the metadata JSON. The `mint-nft` endpoint‚Äôs purpose is to prepare the off-chain metadata needed for the NFT, allowing you to review or edit it before performing the actual on-chain mint.

***

### Prompt Enhancement (`POST /nft/enhancePrompt`)

This optional endpoint uses AI to **enhance or refine a text prompt** for better image generation results. It does *not* generate an image itself, but returns an improved prompt that you can then use with the image generation endpoints.

**Description:** Takes a given prompt and returns a more detailed or refined version of that prompt. This can help yield higher-quality or more specific images from the models by ensuring the prompt is well-crafted. (For example, a short prompt *"a futuristic city"* might be expanded into a more vivid description.)

**Headers:**

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required)
* `Content-Type: application/json` (required)

**Request Body:**

* `prompt` (string, required) ‚Äì The original prompt text that you want to enhance/refine.

**Sample Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/enhancePrompt" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "prompt": "a futuristic city"
         }'
```

**Sample Response:**

```json
{
  "enhancedPrompt": "A sprawling futuristic cityscape at night, illuminated by neon lights and flying vehicles, with towering skyscrapers and advanced technology."
}
```

The response contains an `enhancedPrompt` field with a more descriptive version of the input prompt. You can use this refined prompt in a subsequent image generation call to potentially get better results. Each call to prompt enhancement consumes a small amount of credits (see Pricing & Credits, typically 0.5 credits per enhancement).

***

### Supported Chains (`GET /nft/get-chains`)

Use this endpoint to retrieve the list of blockchain networks supported by the AI NFT Generator for minting NFTs.

**Description:** Returns an array of supported blockchains (networks) on which you can mint the generated NFTs. Each network entry includes its `chainId` and name. By default, only mainnet networks are returned; you can optionally include test networks.

**Headers:**

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required)

**Query Parameters:**

* `testNet` (boolean, optional) ‚Äì If `true`, include testnet chains in the results. If omitted or `false`, only mainnet chains are listed.

**Sample Request:**

```bash
# Fetch only mainnet chains
curl -X GET "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/get-chains?testNet=false" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Sample Response:**

        ]
}
```

{% endcode %}

Each entry in the `chains` list provides a blockchain‚Äôs ID and a human-readable name, and often a `network` type (mainnet or testnet). Use the `chainId` values when calling the generation and minting endpoints (`generate-nft-queue` and `mint-nft`) to specify the target blockchain. For example, use `chainId: 97` with a BSC Testnet wallet address, or `chainId: 1` with an Ethereum address, etc..

*Note:* Ensure the `walletAddress` you provide in the generation call is valid on the chosen chain. The ChainGPT NFT Generator supports multiple blockchains for minting, so choosing the correct chain ID and corresponding wallet is important.

***

### Contract ABI (`GET /nft/abi`)

This endpoint provides the **ABI (Application Binary Interface)** of the ChainGPT NFT smart contract used for minting. Developers can use the ABI to interact with the NFT contract via web3 libraries.

**Description:** Returns the ABI for the ChainGPT NFT Mint Factory smart contract. The ABI is a JSON array describing the contract‚Äôs functions and events. With this, you can programmatically call contract functions (like the mint function) or decode events when integrating on-chain.

**Headers:**

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required)

**Sample Request:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.chaingpt.org/nft/abi" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Sample Response (truncated):**

```json
{
  "abi": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "name": "mint",
      "inputs": [
        { "name": "to", "type": "address" },
        { "name": "tokenURI", "type": "string" }
      ],
      "outputs": [ /* ... */ ]
    },
    {
      "type": "event",
      "name": "NFTMinted",
      "inputs": [ /* ... */ ]
    }
    // ...other functions and events...
  ]
}
```

The actual ABI JSON will include all the contract‚Äôs functions and events. The snippet above illustrates the general structure (e.g., a `mint` function that takes a recipient address and token URI, and an `NFTMinted` event). Using this ABI, you can integrate with the blockchain directly. For instance, after you obtain the NFT metadata via `mint-nft`, you could use the ABI with a web3 library (and the appropriate contract address for the selected `chainId`) to call the `mint` function on the contract, passing in the `walletAddress` (as the `to` address) and the token URI that points to the NFT‚Äôs metadata. This is useful for custom on-chain interactions if not handled automatically by the ChainGPT service.

***

### Supported Models & Parameters

When generating images, choose the appropriate model and parameters for your use case. The table below summarizes the supported models and their capabilities:

| **Model**          | **Base Resolution Range**          | **Max Upscaled Resolution**          | **Max Steps**             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `velogen`          | 512‚Äì768 px (e.g. 512√ó512, 768√ó512) | Up to \~1920√ó1920 px with 2√ó enhance | 1‚Äì4 steps                 |
| `nebula_forge_xl`  | 768‚Äì1024 px (e.g. 1024√ó768)        | Up to \~1536√ó1536 px when upscaled   | 1‚Äì50 steps                |
| `VisionaryForge`   | 768‚Äì1024 px (similar to above)     | Up to \~1536√ó1536 px when upscaled   | 1‚Äì50 steps                |
| `Dale3` (DALL¬∑E 3) | 1024√ó1024 px (fixed)               | *N/A* (no custom upscale)            | *N/A* (no step parameter) |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notes:**

* *Base Resolution* is the native size the model can generate without enhancement. *Max Upscaled* is the approximate maximum size using the `enhance` parameter (`"1x"` or `"2x"`). For example, VeloGen can generate up to \~768px natively, or up to \~1920px when enhanced twice. NebulaForge XL and VisionaryForge can handle up to 1024px natively, or \~1536px with upscaling. Keep the aspect ratio in mind; you can request landscape, portrait, or square dimensions as long as they fall within these ranges.
* If you request an image size beyond a model‚Äôs base range **without** setting `enhance`, the API may automatically apply an enhancement/upscale if possible. However, it‚Äôs recommended to explicitly use the `enhance` parameter if you want a higher resolution output, to be clear about the intent.
* The `steps` parameter controls the number of diffusion/refinement iterations. *VeloGen* is optimized for speed with only a few steps (up to 4). More powerful models like *NebulaForge XL* and *VisionaryForge* can run up to 50 steps for finer detail. Higher step counts can significantly improve image quality for those models, at the cost of longer generation time. (The DALL¬∑E 3 model does not use a custom steps setting ‚Äì it generates at a fixed quality per prompt).
* **Prompt Enhancement:** If your initial prompt is short or not yielding the desired results, consider using the prompt enhancement endpoint before generation. The `POST /nft/enhancePrompt` call can provide a more detailed prompt, which can help ensure you get a good result on the first generation attempt. This can be especially useful when using the more expensive models or high step counts.
  {% endhint %}

***

### Pricing & Credits

The ChainGPT NFT Generator API uses a credit-based system. Each API call deducts a certain number of credits from your account. The cost depends on the model and options used. Below is a brief overview of credit costs per image (see the [**Pricing & Credits**](/chaingpt-v1-docs/dev-docs-b2b-saas-api-and-sdk/ai-nft-generator-api-and-sdk/pricing-and-credits) page for full details):

* **VeloGen, NebulaForge XL, VisionaryForge:** **1 credit** per image for base resolution generation. If you use the enhancement (`enhance = "1x"` or `"2x"` for higher resolution), it costs an additional 1 credit, for a total of **2 credits** per image with upscale. *(E.g. generating a simple image = 1 credit; generating with HD enhancement = 2 credits.)*
* **Prompt Enhancement:** \~**0.5 credits** per call. Enhancing a prompt via `POST /nft/enhancePrompt` deducts a small fraction of a credit (since it does not generate an image, just text).
* **Other Endpoints:** Non-generative endpoints such as checking progress, retrieving supported chains, or fetching the contract ABI do not consume credits. The `mint-nft` endpoint for metadata preparation also does not charge credits (it assumes the generation was already paid for), aside from any separate blockchain transaction costs which are outside the scope of the API.
* **Extras:** DALL¬∑E 3 (Dale3) model: Higher cost due to external API usage. For a 1024√ó1024 image at standard quality (no upscale), 4.75 credits\~\~\~\~ are charged. Enabling HD upscale ("2x") for a 1024px image doubles this to \~9.5 credits. For other resolutions, standard generation is \~9.5 credits and HD upscaled is \~14.25 credits per image. (In summary, DALL¬∑E generations range roughly from 4.75 up to 14.25 credits each depending on size/quality.)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You must have sufficient credits in your ChainGPT account before calling these APIs. If your credits are exhausted or the API key has no credits, calls to generate images (or enhance prompts) will fail (typically with a 401 Unauthorized or an error message indicating insufficient credits). Be sure to top up credits via the ChainGPT web app as needed. Full pricing details and credit packages are available on the ChainGPT Pricing & Membership Plans page.

# SDK Reference

## ChainGPT AI NFT Generator SDK Reference

### Introduction

The ChainGPT AI NFT Generator SDK provides a JavaScript/TypeScript interface for generating AI-driven images and minting them as NFTs. It wraps the ChainGPT AI NFT Generator REST API, allowing developers to easily integrate image generation and NFT creation into their applications without dealing with raw HTTP requests or file handling. This reference guide covers the SDK's installation, configuration, and major functions, focusing on how to use the SDK in Node.js or web environments to create and mint AI-generated images.

**Key capabilities:**

* Generate AI art images from text prompts using ChainGPT‚Äôs proprietary models.
* Optionally enhance (upscale) images for higher resolution outputs.
* Create NFTs by generating an image *and* preparing it for minting in one flow.
* Mint the generated image as an NFT on various blockchain networks with a single call.
* Check generation progress for queued jobs and retrieve supported blockchain info.
* Enhance text prompts for better image generation results.

*Note:* This guide is for the **SDK usage**. If you prefer to call the REST API directly, refer to the API Reference. For a step-by-step tutorial on using the NFT Generator (with examples), see the QuickStart Guide. Ensure you have an API key from the ChainGPT platform and sufficient credits (or an appropriate subscription plan) before using the SDK (the SDK will throw an error if your API key is invalid or you run out of credits).

***

### Installation

**Install the SDK Package:** The ChainGPT NFT Generator SDK is available as an npm package `@chaingpt/nft`. Add it to your project using npm or Yarn:

```bash
npm install --save @chaingpt/nft
# or
yarn add @chaingpt/nft
```

This will install the SDK and its TypeScript type declarations.

**Import and initialize the SDK:** The SDK exports an `Nft` class. Import this class and instantiate it with your API key (obtained from the ChainGPT developer dashboard):

```js
// Import the Nft class from the SDK
const { Nft } = require('@chaingpt/nft');  // CommonJS
// import { Nft } from '@chaingpt/nft';    // ES Module / TypeScript

// Initialize the SDK with your API key
const nft = new Nft({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'  // ChainGPT API Key for authentication
  // ... you can include other config options if supported
});
```

Only the `apiKey` is required to configure the SDK. The SDK uses this key to authenticate your requests to ChainGPT‚Äôs API. By default, it will use ChainGPT‚Äôs hosted endpoints‚Äîno additional setup is needed beyond providing a valid API key.

**Note:** Keep your API key secure (do not hard-code it in client-side code or expose it publicly). Also ensure you have sufficient API credits or an active plan to perform NFT generations. If your key is invalid or you exceed your quota, the SDK will throw an `Errors.NftError` (see **Error Handling** below).

***

### SDK Usage

Below are the primary methods provided by the `Nft` SDK instance. Each method is documented with its purpose, expected parameters, return values, and example usage.

#### `generateImage(options)`

**Description:** Generates an image from a text prompt using one of ChainGPT‚Äôs AI models, returning the image data. This function **does not** mint an NFT; it only performs image generation. Use `generateImage` when you want to create an image (for example, to let a user preview it) without immediately putting it on-chain. To generate an image *and* directly prepare it for minting, use `generateNft()` instead.

**Parameters:** *(passed as properties of the `options` object)*

* `prompt` (string, **required**): The text prompt describing the desired image. This can be any creative description of the image you want (e.g. *"A futuristic city skyline at sunset, neon pink and orange hues"*).
* `model` (string, **required**): The identifier of the AI model to use for generation. Supported models include **`velogen`**, **`nebula_forge_xl`**, **`VisionaryForge`**. Each model has a different style or aesthetic (e.g. photorealistic, anime, 3D render, etc.). *ChainGPT‚Äôs proprietary models are `velogen`, `nebula_forge_xl`, and `VisionaryForge`.*&#x20;
* `image`  (string(Url), optional): The **image URL** to use as the base or reference (can be left out if you want *pure text-to-image*).
* `enhance` (string, *optional*): Image enhancement/upscaling level. Use `"1x"` for single enhancement, `"2x"` for double enhancement, or omit / use an empty string for no enhancement. Enhancement will upscale the image (improving resolution/quality) and is only supported by certain models (currently `velogen`, `nebula_forge_xl`, `VisionaryForge`). If an unsupported model is used with this parameter, the enhancement request is ignored.
* `steps` (number, *optional*): The number of diffusion or refinement steps to use for image generation. More steps can produce more detailed or refined images at the cost of longer generation time. Each model has its own supported range (e.g. `velogen` supports 1‚Äì4 steps, default is 2; `nebula_forge_xl` & `VisionaryForge` supports up to 50, default is 25). If not provided, the model‚Äôs default number of steps is used.
* `width` (number, *optional*): The width of the generated image in pixels.
* `height` (number, *optional*): The height of the generated image in pixels.
* `style` (string, optional): If you include a style, the image will be generated according to the specified style. Available styles are listed below. ([Listed Styles](https://docs.chaingpt.org/dev-docs-b2b-saas-api-and-sdk/ai-nft-generator-api-and-sdk/quickstart-guide#supported-styles))
* `isCharacterPreserve` (bool, optional): Tells the generator to **preserve the main character‚Äôs identity and features** from the reference image (`image` URL) while still applying the `prompt.`
* `traits` (Array , optional): Traits are an optional array of objects. If provided, images will be generated based on the specified trait ratios. For example, if the array includes two traits‚Äî`Background` with values `Heaven` (ratio: 20) and `Hell` (ratio: 60)‚Äîand you request 5 images, approximately 1 will use `Heaven` and 3 will use `Hell` background.You can adjust traits and ratios to guide image generation accordingly.

**Note on image size:** Supported `width` √ó `height` combinations (aspect ratios) depend on the model (and whether enhancement is used). For example, **Velogen** supports base resolutions like 512√ó512 (square), 768√ó512 (landscape), 512√ó768 (portrait). With 2√ó enhancement, it can produce up to \~1920√ó1920 (square) and corresponding larger rectangles. **Nebula Forge XL** and **VisionaryForge** have their own supported dimensions (see **Supported Models & Settings** below for detailed resolution options). If you request a size that the model doesn‚Äôt support, the API may return an error or adjust to the nearest valid size. If `height`/`width` are not specified, the SDK will default to the model‚Äôs base default (usually a square format such as 512√ó512 or 1024√ó1024 depending on the model).

**Returns:** A Promise that resolves to an object containing the generated image data. On success, you can expect the image bytes (binary data) to be available (typically under a field like `data` or similar). The image is in JPEG format by default. You can take the returned binary data and save it to a file, send it to a client, or further process it as needed.

**Example ‚Äì Generate an image and save to a file (with explanations):**

```js
const fs = require('fs');

async function main() {
  const generatedImage = await nft.generateImage({
    prompt: 'cars racing to the finish', // Prompt to be used to generate the NFT art
    model: 'velogen', // Model to be used to generate the NFT art
    enhance: 'original', // enhance imgae once or twice
    steps: 2, // steps parameter passed while image generation
    height: 512, //height of the resulting image
    width: 512, // width of the resulting image
    style: 'cinematic', //sample value for style
    traits: [
      {
        trait_type: 'Background',
        value: [
          { value: 'Heaven', ratio: 20 },
          { value: 'Hell', ratio: 60 },
          { value: 'garden', ratio: 20 },
        ],
      },
      {
        trait_type: 'contrast',
        value: [
          { value: 'dark', ratio: 20 },
          { value: 'light', ratio: 80 },
        ],
      },
    ],
  });

  // Save the buffer directly to a file
  fs.writeFileSync('generated-image.jpg', Buffer.from(generatedImage.data.data));
}

main()
```

**Example ‚ÄìGenerate an image to image using Velogen**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

async function main() {
  const generatedImage = await nft.generateImage({
    prompt: "medieval fantasy knight, wearing armor", // Prompt to be used to generate the NFT art
    image: "https://chaingpt.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sdk/cgpt-bot.jpg",
    model: 'velogen', // Model to be used to generate the NFT art
    enhance: 'original', // enhance imgae once or twice
    steps: 3,
    height: 1024, //height of the resulting image
    width: 1024, // width of the resulting image

  });

  // Save the buffer directly to a file
  fs.writeFileSync('generated-image.jpg', Buffer.from(generatedImage.data.data));
}

main();
```

In this example, we used the `velogen` model to generate a 1024√ó1024 image from the given prompt, with a single upscaling enhancement. The resulting image bytes are written to **generated-image.jpg**. After running this code, that file will contain the AI-generated artwork. You can adjust the `prompt`, `model`, and other parameters as needed

**Example ‚Äì Character Reference NFT Image Generation**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

async function main() {
  const generatedImage = await nftInstance.generateImage({
    prompt: "musician playing guitar under stage lights", // Prompt to be used to generate the NFT art
    image: "https://chaingpt.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sdk/cgpt-bot.jpg",
    model: 'velogen', // Allowed models velogen, VisionaryForge, nebula_forge_xl
    enhance: 'original', // enhance image once pass '1x' or twice pass '2x'
    steps: 3,
    height: 1024, //height of the resulting image
    width: 1024, // width of the resulting image
    isCharacterPreserve: true // to preserve the character

  });

  // Save the buffer directly to a file
  fs.writeFileSync('generated-image.jpg', Buffer.from(generatedImage.data.data));
}

main();
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If `isCharacterPreserve` is set to `true`, you must also provide a valid `image` URL. It will charge an extra 5 credits.
{% endhint %}

#### Synchronous NFT Generation

#### `generateNft(options)`&#x20;

**Description:** Generates an image *and* prepares NFT metadata from a text prompt, intended for minting. This call handles the AI image creation similarly to `generateImage()`, but also registers the result for minting (on ChainGPT‚Äôs backend) and returns metadata needed to proceed with minting. Typically, after `generateNft` completes, you would call `mintNft()` to actually mint the NFT on-chain. This method is **synchronous** in the sense that it waits for the image generation to finish before returning, so it can take some time (usually 30‚Äì60 seconds for the image to be generated). Under the hood, this corresponds to an API call that generates the image and prepares the NFT in one step.

**Parameters:** *(passed in an `options` object; includes all `generateImage` parameters plus NFT-specific fields)*

* **All image generation parameters from** `generateImage()`: You can include `prompt`, `model`, `enhance`, `steps`, `width`, `height` with the same meanings as described above. These control the image generation part of this call.
* `walletAddress` (string, **required**): The public wallet address that will eventually own the NFT. This is the address to which the NFT will be minted (transferred) when you call `mintNft()`. Make sure this is a valid address on the blockchain network you intend to use.
* `chainId` (number, **required**): The blockchain network ID where the NFT will be minted. ChainGPT‚Äôs NFT generator supports many networks (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Tron, and more). For example: use `1` for Ethereum Mainnet, `56` for BNB Smart Chain (BSC) Mainnet, `137` for Polygon, etc. You can retrieve the full list of supported networks and their IDs at runtime with the `getChains()` method. Ensure the `chainId` you provide corresponds to the network of the provided wallet address.
* `style` (string, optional): If you include a style, the image will be generated according to the specified style. Available styles are listed below. ([Listed Styles](https://docs.chaingpt.org/dev-docs-b2b-saas-api-and-sdk/ai-nft-generator-api-and-sdk/quickstart-guide#supported-styles))
* `traits` (Array , optional): Traits are an optional array of objects. If provided, images will be generated based on the specified trait ratios. For example, if the array includes two traits‚Äî`Background` with values `Heaven` (ratio: 20) and `Hell` (ratio: 60)‚Äîand you request 5 images, approximately 1 will use `Heaven` and 3 will use `Hell` background.You can adjust traits and ratios to guide image generation accordingly.

*(There are no parameters for NFT name/description in this step ‚Äì those are provided later to the `mintNft()` call.)*

**Returns:** A Promise that resolves to an object containing the generated NFT data. On success, the result will include:

* The **image data** (similar to what `generateImage` returns, i.e. the binary image bytes).
* A **`collectionId`** (string or UUID) that uniquely identifies this generation job and the associated metadata on ChainGPT‚Äôs backend.

The `collectionId` is important: it references the saved AI-generated image and metadata. You will use it to either check the generation status (if queued) or to mint the NFT. In the case of `generateNft()` (synchronous), the promise only resolves **after** the image is fully generated, so at that point the image is ready and `collectionId` can be used directly for minting.

**Note:** After `generateNft()` completes, the NFT is *not yet on the blockchain*. It‚Äôs essentially a prepared record (image + metadata) awaiting the minting step. You must call `mintNft()` with the returned `collectionId` to actually mint the NFT on-chain. This two-step process (generate then mint) allows you to, for example, confirm with a user or display the image before incurring blockchain costs.

**Example ‚Äì Generate an NFT then mint it (with explanations):**

```js
// 1. Generate the NFT image and metadata (synchronously)
const genResult = await nft.generateNft({
  prompt: "A cute cartoon cat astronaut, sticker illustration",
  model: "VisionaryForge",
  enhance: "",             // no enhancement (empty string or omit for none)
  height: 1024, width: 1024,
  walletAddress: "0xABC123...DEF",  // the recipient wallet address for the NFT
  chainId: 97,                      // target chain ID (97 = BSC Testnet in this example)
  amount:1,                 //The number of images generated for the collection.
   style: 'cinematic',       //Style of image
  traits: [
      {
        trait_type: 'Background',
        value: [
          { value: 'Heaven', ratio: 20 },
          { value: 'Hell', ratio: 60 },
          { value: 'garden', ratio: 20 },
        ],
      },
      {
        trait_type: 'contrast',
        value: [
          { value: 'dark', ratio: 20 },
          { value: 'light', ratio: 80 },
        ],
      },
    ],
});
console.log("Generation completed. Collection ID:", genResult.data.collectionId);

// 2. Mint the generated NFT on-chain using the returned collectionId
const mintResult = await nft.mintNft({
  collectionId: genResult.data.collectionId,  // use the collectionId obtained from generateNft
  name: "Space Cat Sticker",                  // human-readable name for the NFT
  description: "An AI-generated cat astronaut sticker, created via ChainGPT",  // description metadata
  symbol: "CAT",                               // symbol for the NFT collection (if a new collection is created)
  ids: [1,....,n]
});
console.log("NFT minted! Transaction/result:", mintResult);
```

In this example, we first call `generateNft()` with a prompt and parameters including the wallet address and chain ID where we want to mint. When this completes, we get a `collectionId` (printed to console) which references the generated image and metadata. We then call `mintNft()` with that `collectionId` and provide an NFT name, description, and symbol. The SDK then handles the blockchain transaction to mint the NFT to the specified address on BSC Testnet (chainId 97). The `mintResult` would contain information about the minting operation (such as a transaction hash or token ID, depending on the implementation).

**Example ‚Äì Production usage (generate then mint, minimal code):**

```js
// Generate NFT (blocking until ready) and then mint it on BSC Mainnet
const { data: nftData } = await nft.generateNft({ 
  prompt: "Epic dragon portrait in medieval style", 
  model: "velogen",
  walletAddress: "0x...YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS", 
  chainId: 56,  // BNB Chain Mainnet
  height: 512,
  width: 512,
  amount:1
});
await nft.mintNft({
  collectionId: nftData.collectionId,
  name: "Epic Dragon", 
  description: "AI-generated medieval dragon art", 
  symbol: "DRGN"
});
```

The above snippet omits comments for brevity. It generates an NFT on BSC (chain 56) for the given wallet address, then immediately mints it with a name, description, and symbol. In a real application, you should include error handling around these calls (e.g., try/catch) and perhaps update your UI to inform the user of progress between generation and minting.

#### `generateNftWithQueue(options)` ‚Äì Asynchronous/Queued Generation

**Description:** Initiates an NFT generation task asynchronously, without waiting for the image to be fully generated. This function returns quickly with a `collectionId` that represents the queued generation job on ChainGPT‚Äôs servers. The actual image creation then happens in the background. You can use the returned `collectionId` to poll the job‚Äôs status via `getNftProgress()` and later call `mintNft()` to mint the NFT once the image is ready. This queued approach is useful for handling multiple generations in parallel or offloading longer generation times without blocking your application flow.

**Parameters:** Same as `generateNft(options)` above. You must provide all required fields (`prompt`, `model`, `walletAddress`, `chainId`) and any optional generation settings (`enhance`, `steps`, `height`, `width`) as needed.

**Returns:** A Promise that resolves to an object containing at least a `collectionId` for the queued generation request. The image data will **not** be available immediately in the response, since generation is still in progress. The `collectionId` is the key identifier you'll use to check progress and eventually mint the NFT. Essentially, if this call succeeds, it means the generation job was accepted and is now processing on the server.

**Example ‚Äì Queue an NFT generation and check progress (with explanations):**

```js
// 1. Start the NFT generation job (async queue)
const queueResult = await nft.generateNftWithQueue({
  prompt: "Abstract colorful swirl painting, high resolution",
  model: "nebula_forge_xl",
  walletAddress: "0xDEF456...789",
  height: 512,  
  width: 512,
  amount: 1,
  chainId: 1   // Ethereum Mainnet
});
const jobId = queueResult.data.collectionId;
console.log("Generation queued. Collection ID:", jobId);

// 2. Periodically check the generation progress
let progressInfo;
do {
  progressInfo = await nft.getNftProgress({ collectionId: jobId });
  const percent = progressInfo.data.progress;   // e.g., progress percentage
  console.log(`Generation progress: ${percent}%`);
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 5000));  // wait 5 seconds before checking again
} while (progressInfo.data.status !== "completed");
// Loop until the status indicates completion (status might go from "processing" to "completed")

console.log("Generation complete! Now minting the NFT...");
// 3. Mint the NFT now that the image generation is done
await nft.mintNft({
  collectionId: jobId,
  name: "Color Swirl Art",
  description: "AI-generated abstract painting",
  symbol: "ART"
});
console.log("NFT minted on chain.");
```

In this example, we queue an NFT generation using `generateNftWithQueue()`. The call returns immediately with a `collectionId` (stored in `jobId`). We then enter a loop to poll the job‚Äôs status using `getNftProgress()`, every 5 seconds, logging the progress percentage. Once the `status` becomes `"completed"` (which implies 100% progress), we proceed to call `mintNft()` with the same `collectionId` to mint the NFT on-chain. In a real application, you might use a longer delay between polls or integrate a webhook/callback if available, rather than busy polling. You can also queue multiple jobs in parallel and poll each one, which makes this approach suitable for generating large collections of NFTs asynchronously.

**Example ‚Äì Production usage (queue generation, minimal):**

```js
// Queue NFT generation (non-blocking call)
const { data: queued } = await nft.generateNftWithQueue({ 
  prompt: "Portrait of an AI robot", 
  model: "velogen", 
  walletAddress: "0x...ADDR", 
  height: 512,
  width: 512,
  amount: 1,
  chainId: 137  // Polygon Mainnet
});
console.log("Queued job ID:", queued.collectionId);
// (Later, use getNftProgress() and mintNft() as shown above once the job is done)
```

Here we simply queue the generation and log the job ID. The subsequent steps (polling progress and minting) would be similar to the detailed example above. This pattern allows your code to continue doing other work or handling other requests while images are being generated in the background.

#### `getNftProgress(options)`

**Description:** Checks the status of an NFT generation job that was started with `generateNftWithQueue()` (or even a `generateNft()` call if you want to poll its progress, though `generateNft()` usually waits internally). It returns information about the generation progress, such as a percentage complete or a status indicator.

**Parameters:**

* `collectionId` (string, **required**): The unique identifier of the NFT generation job to query. This is the `collectionId` returned by `generateNft` or `generateNftWithQueue`. Without a valid `collectionId`, the API cannot identify which job‚Äôs status to retrieve.

**Returns:** A Promise that resolves to an object containing progress information for the specified job. The exact structure of the data may include fields like `progress` (number) and `status` (string). For example, a successful response might be `{ progress: 100, status: "completed", ... }` when the generation is finished. Before completion, you might see a lower `progress` value (e.g. 0 to 99) and a status like `"processing"` or `"queued"`. If an invalid `collectionId` is provided, the SDK will throw an error or you might get a response indicating the job wasn‚Äôt found.

Typically, you will call this method repeatedly (polling) until the `status` is `"completed"` or `progress` reaches 100, then proceed to mint the NFT. The frequency of polling can be adjusted based on how long generations typically take (e.g., polling every few seconds).

**Example ‚Äì Basic usage:**

```js
const progressRes = await nft.getNftProgress({ collectionId: jobId });
if (progressRes.data.progress === 100) {
  console.log("Job completed!");
}
```

**Example ‚Äì Production snippet (single progress check):**

```js
// Check the current progress of a generation job
const status = await nft.getNftProgress({ collectionId: "YOUR_COLLECTION_ID" });
console.log("Current progress:", status.data.progress, "%");
```

In practice, you would integrate this into a loop or schedule as shown in the queued generation example. Use `getNftProgress()` to inform users about the generation status (e.g., a loading bar) or to trigger the next step of your workflow when the image is ready.

#### `mintNft(options)`

**Description:** Mints an NFT on the specified blockchain, using a previously generated image/metadata. This is the final step in the NFT creation process, taking the output of `generateNft` (identified by a `collectionId`) and writing the NFT to the blockchain. The method also lets you set the NFT‚Äôs name, description, and symbol (metadata) if they weren't already set. Under the hood, this will interact with ChainGPT‚Äôs NFT minting smart contract to either create a new NFT in an existing collection or deploy a new collection, then mint the token to the provided wallet address.

**Parameters:**

* `collectionId` (string, **required**): The ID of the generated NFT content to mint. This is obtained from a prior `generateNft` or `generateNftWithQueue` call. It tells the system which image/metadata to use for minting.
* `name` (string, **required**): The name for the NFT. This could be the title of the artwork or any descriptive name. This will appear as the token‚Äôs name in metadata.
* `description` (string, *optional*): A text description for the NFT. This is stored in the token‚Äôs metadata, providing details or context for the artwork. (If not provided, it might be left blank or a default in the metadata.)
* `symbol` (string, *optional*): The symbol (short identifier) for the NFT collection. If this minting operation creates a new NFT collection (smart contract), this symbol will be used for that collection (similar to a ticker or shorthand for the collection). If the NFT is being minted into an existing collection, this parameter might be ignored. For one-off mints or testing, you can use any short string (e.g. "AI" or "ART").

**Returns:** A Promise that resolves to an object containing the result of the mint operation. On success, this will typically include details such as:

* Confirmation that the NFT was minted (e.g., a success status or the minted token‚Äôs ID/URL).
* Transaction details, like a transaction hash, if the mint involved an on-chain transaction.
* Possibly the address of the new NFT collection contract (if one was deployed) or confirmation of the collection used.

The exact fields returned may vary, but the key outcome is that the image identified by `collectionId` is now minted as an NFT owned by `walletAddress` (which was provided during generation). The promise will only resolve once the minting is complete (which may involve waiting for a blockchain transaction).

After calling `mintNft()`, the NFT is live on the blockchain. You can then fetch it from the blockchain or via ChainGPT‚Äôs APIs, and it will have the metadata (name, description, etc.) that you provided.

**Example ‚Äì Mint an NFT directly (assuming image is already generated):**

```js
await nft.mintNft({
  collectionId: "abcd1234-ef56-...-xyz",  // collection ID from a previous generateNft call
  name: "My AI Artwork",
  description: "This NFT image was generated by AI via ChainGPT",
  symbol: "AINFT",
  ids: [1,....,n]
});
console.log("Mint successful!");
```

In this example, we directly call `mintNft()` using a known `collectionId` (from a prior generation step) and provide the desired metadata. If the operation succeeds, the console will log a success message. In a real scenario, you‚Äôd want to wrap this in a try/catch to handle errors (like network issues or insufficient permissions) and perhaps confirm the transaction result.

**Example ‚Äì Production snippet:**

```js
// Finalize NFT minting (production use)
const result = await nft.mintNft({ collectionId, name: "Artwork #1", symbol: "ART" });
// (Add error handling as needed)
```

Typically, you will call `mintNft()` once per generated image to put it on-chain. Remember to catch errors from this call as it involves external blockchain interaction (see **Error Handling** below). For instance, if the user‚Äôs wallet is invalid or if there are network fees required that the system cannot cover, you would get an error.

#### Enhance Your Prompt

Update your prompt by setting the enhancement level to receive a response tailored to the enhanced prompt.

```javascript
const { Nft } = require('@chaingpt/nft');
const nftInstance = new Nft({ apiKey: 'Your ChainGPT API Key' });

async function main() {
  const enhancedPrompt = await nftInstance.enhancePrompt({
    prompt: 'lion in jungle',
  });
  console.log(enhancedPrompt);
}
main();
```

#### &#x20;Toggle NFT Visibility

toggle the **visibility status** (e.g., from public to private or vice versa) of an NFT collection using the `@chaingpt/nft` SDK.

```javascript
const { Nft } = require('@chaingpt/nft');
const nftInstance = new Nft({ apiKey: 'Your ChainGPT API Key' });

async function main() {
  const response = await nftInstance.toggleNftVisibility({
    collectionId: '<collection id>',
  });
  console.log(response);
}

### Supported Models & Settings

*(This section provides reference details on the supported AI models, image enhancements, and output formats available in the ChainGPT NFT Generator SDK.)*

* **Supported AI Models:** You can choose from several AI models via the `model` parameter in `generateImage`/`generateNft`:

  * **`velogen`** ‚Äì ChainGPT‚Äôs VeloGen model, suitable for realistic or general-purpose image generation.
  * **`nebula_forge_xl`** ‚Äì ChainGPT‚Äôs high-resolution model, useful for detailed and high-quality imagery.
  * **`VisionaryForge`** ‚Äì ChainGPT‚Äôs creative model for artistic or concept art styles.
  * **`Dale3`** ‚Äì An integration of OpenAI‚Äôs DALL¬∑E 3 model (optional). This model can be used for varied art styles and compositions, though it may not support all the advanced settings (enhancements, etc.) that the ChainGPT proprietary models do.

  Each model has different strengths and styles. We recommend experimenting with the proprietary models (`velogen`, `nebula_forge_xl`, `VisionaryForge`) to see which best suits your use case.&#x20;
* **Image Formats:** Generated images are returned in a binary form (typically a buffer containing JPEG data). By default, the images generated via the API/SDK are in **JPEG** format (as seen by the `.jpg` extension in examples). The SDK itself does not expose a parameter to select the image format (e.g., PNG vs JPEG); it will always return the image data as provided by the API (JPEG). If you require a different format, you can convert the image bytes to another format using an image processing library after you receive the data.
* **Enhancement (Upscaling) Options:** The `enhance` parameter allows you to request higher-resolution outputs:

  * `"1x"` ‚Äì Single enhancement (image is upscaled once, roughly doubling the resolution).
  * `"2x"` ‚Äì Double enhancement (upscaled twice, resulting in an even larger image).

  Only certain models support enhancement/upscaling (currently **velogen**, **nebula\_forge\_xl**, and **VisionaryForge**). Using `"1x"` or `"2x"` with those models will produce larger, more detailed images (as shown in their supported resolutions below). If you attempt to enhance on a model that doesn‚Äôt support it (such as `Dale3`), the request will simply generate at the model‚Äôs default resolution without upscale. Keep in mind that enhanced images consume more processing and may count as additional credit usage.
* **Resolution & Aspect Ratios:** Each model supports specific image resolutions, especially when using enhancement:

  * **Velogen:** Base output resolutions include 512√ó512 (square), 768√ó512 (landscape), 512√ó768 (portrait). With 2√ó enhancement, approximate maximum resolutions are 1920√ó1920 (square), 1920√ó1280 (landscape), 1280√ó1920 (portrait).
  * **Nebula Forge XL:** Base outputs are 1024√ó1024, 1024√ó768, 768√ó1024. With upscaling (enhancement), it can go up to \~1536√ó1536 (square), 1536√ó1024 (landscape), 1024√ó1536 (portrait).
  * **VisionaryForge:** Base outputs are 1024√ó1024, 1024√ó768, 768√ó1024 (similar to Nebula‚Äôs base). With upscaling, up to around 1536√ó1536, 1536√ó1024, 1024√ó1536.
  * **Dale3:** (1024x1024, upscaling or enhancement isn't available).&#x20;

  When specifying the `width` and `height` in your requests, it‚Äôs best to stick to one of the supported aspect ratio combinations for the chosen model (as listed above) to get optimal results. If you choose a non-standard size, the API might adjust the output size or return an error. For simplicity, using a square resolution (512√ó512 for smaller images, or 1024√ó1024 for larger images) is a safe choice across models.
* **Default Values:** If you omit certain optional parameters in the generation calls:
  * `enhance` ‚Äì Defaults to no enhancement (no upscaling) if not provided.
  * `steps` ‚Äì Defaults to the model‚Äôs built-in default (for example, 2 steps for VeloGen, 25 for Nebula Forge XL) if not specified.
  * `height`/`width` ‚Äì Typically default to the model‚Äôs default resolution (often the base square, e.g., 512√ó512 for some models or 1024√ó1024 for others). It‚Äôs recommended to explicitly set these for clarity.

### Error Handling

The ChainGPT NFT SDK provides a structured error handling mechanism to help you catch and manage errors from any SDK call (image generation, minting, etc.).

When something goes wrong (such as a network issue, an invalid API request, or an error returned from the ChainGPT API), the SDK will throw an error of type **`Errors.NftError`**. This is a custom error class provided by the SDK. It includes a message describing the error, and it may include additional information such as an HTTP status code or an error payload from the API.

**How to handle errors:** Ensure you wrap your SDK calls in a `try...catch` block in your async function. In the `catch`, you can check if the caught error is an instance of `Errors.NftError` to distinguish it from other types of exceptions.

**Example ‚Äì Error handling pattern:**

```js
import { Errors } from '@chaingpt/nft';

try {
  const response = await nft.generateNft({ /* ...parameters... */ });
  // Use the response normally if successful
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof Errors.NftError) {
    console.error("ChainGPT SDK error:", error.message);
    // You could also inspect error.response or error.code if needed
  } else {
    // Some other unexpected error (programming error, etc.)
    console.error("Unexpected error:", error);
  }
}
```

In the above snippet, if `nft.generateNft()` fails (for example, due to an invalid API key, a 400 Bad Request from the API, or a network timeout), the catch block will execute. The error‚Äôs message (`error.message`) usually provides a human-readable description of what went wrong (e.g. "Unauthorized" for invalid API key, or a specific validation message). By checking `instanceof Errors.NftError`, we ensure we‚Äôre handling errors thrown by the ChainGPT SDK. Any other error would fall to the `else` block (which could be a coding mistake or something unrelated).

**Common error scenarios to handle:**

* *Authentication failures:* If your API key is missing, incorrect, or expired, the SDK will throw an `NftError` (often indicating a 401 or 403 HTTP error under the hood). You should catch this and prompt for a correct key or notify about invalid credentials.
* *Invalid parameters:* If you pass values that the API cannot process (e.g., an unsupported image resolution, or missing a required field like `walletAddress`), the API will respond with a 400 error and the SDK will throw an `NftError` with details. Check the message to adjust your request.
* *Generation failures:* In rare cases, the AI might fail to generate an image or the job might encounter an internal error. This could result in an error or a job status that indicates failure. Handle this by catching the error or checking for a failure status in `getNftProgress()`.
* *Network issues:* If the SDK cannot reach the ChainGPT API (due to network outage or timeout), it will throw an `NftError` indicating a network error. You might implement retries or inform the user to check their connection.

By consistently catching `Errors.NftError`, you can gracefully handle all these cases. The SDK abstracts away the need to manually parse HTTP responses; any non-2xx HTTP response or other failure will result in a thrown `NftError` that you can catch in one place. This makes it easier to implement robust error-handling logic (such as retries, user notifications, or logging) around SDK calls.

# Pricing & Credits

## Pricing & Credits ‚Äì ChainGPT AI NFT Generator

ChainGPT‚Äôs AI NFT Generator (API & SDK) uses a **credit-based pricing model** for all image generation and utilities. This means every request consumes **ChainGPT Credits (CGPTc)**, where **1 credit = $0.01 USD**. The pricing is **consistent across the API, SDK, and web app** ‚Äì there is no markup for API usage. Developers only pay per use (pay-as-you-go), making costs transparent and easy to track.

{% hint style="info" %}
*Note: Basic free daily usage is available on the platform for single-image generation, but programmatic use beyond those limits will consume credits. If you want to try out our models & application for free, visit :* [*https://NFT.ChainGPT.org*](https://nft.chaingpt.org)*.*&#x20;
{% endhint %}

***

### Image Generation Pricing

ChainGPT‚Äôs NFT Generator offers **three AI models** for image creation, each suited to different needs:

* **VeloGen** ‚Äì a fast, efficient model for quick drafts.
* **NebulaForge XL** ‚Äì a high-fidelity model (XL) for premium, detailed outputs.
* **VisionaryForge** ‚Äì a creative model for imaginative, high-quality visuals.

Despite their differences in speed and quality, **all in-house models cost the same base amount in credits per image**. You can customize each generation by adjusting the **number of diffusion steps** (which refines quality) and the output **resolution**, without changing the base credit cost. The table below summarizes pricing per image for each model, including optional enhancements:

<table><thead><tr><th width="127.3515625">Model</th><th width="86.2421875">Steps</th><th width="282.01953125">Resolution</th><th>Credits Per Image</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>VeloGen</strong></td><td>1‚Äì2</td><td>512√ó512, 512√ó768, 640√ó640</td><td>0.4 Credits</td></tr><tr><td><strong>VeloGen</strong></td><td>3‚Äì4</td><td>512√ó512, 512√ó768, 640√ó640</td><td>0.6 Credits</td></tr><tr><td><strong>VeloGen</strong></td><td>1‚Äì2</td><td>1024√ó1024, 1024√ó768</td><td>0.8 Credits</td></tr><tr><td><strong>VeloGen</strong></td><td>3‚Äì4</td><td>1024√ó1024, 1024√ó768</td><td>1 Credit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NebulaForge XL</strong></td><td>1‚Äì25</td><td>1024√ó1024, 768√ó1024, 1024√ó768</td><td>1 Credit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NebulaForge XL</strong></td><td>26‚Äì50</td><td>1024√ó1024, 768√ó1024, 1024√ó768</td><td>1.25 Credits</td></tr><tr><td><strong>VisionaryForge</strong></td><td>1‚Äì25</td><td>1024√ó1024, 768√ó1024, 1024√ó768</td><td>1 Credit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>VisionaryForge</strong></td><td>26‚Äì50</td><td>1024√ó1024, 768√ó1024, 1024√ó768</td><td>1.25 Credits</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
üí° **Tip:** You can significantly enhance image quality or double the resolution by applying the **Upscale (1x or 2x)** utility feature‚Äîsee details below.
{% endhint %}

**Key Points:**

* **Base Generation Cost:** Generating an image with any of the three models costs **1 credit per image** by default. This covers any prompt and any supported base resolution, regardless of how many steps are used. (Using more steps yields higher quality but may take longer; it does *not* increase the credit cost.)
* **Upscaling Cost:** If you request **HD/Enhanced output**, the system will automatically apply the upscaler. This roughly doubles the cost ‚Äì **+1 credit for a single enhancement** (so 2 credits total). All models support upscaling; for instance, VeloGen can upscale a 512px image to \~1920px. Upscaling twice (for even larger images) adds another credit (total 3 credits), though one pass is usually sufficient.
* **Model Selection:** Using **VeloGen** is most **cost-efficient** for rapid prototyping or bulk previews ‚Äì it generates images extremely fast with fewer diffusion steps. **NebulaForge XL** and **VisionaryForge**, on the other hand, produce more **premium-quality** images with finer detail (supporting up to 50 steps of refinement). They are ideal for final renders or when image fidelity is paramount. **All three models cost 1 credit per base image**, so you can choose the model based on your quality/speed needs without worrying about price differences. *(Third-party models (e.g. OpenAI‚Äôs DALL¬∑E) are also available for compatibility, but they have a separate pricing structure and are not the focus here.)*

### Utilities Pricing

In addition to image generation, the ChainGPT NFT API provides several utility features to enhance your results or enforce content guidelines. Below is a breakdown of these tools, including which are free and which consume credits:

<table><thead><tr><th width="131.6328125">Utility Tool</th><th width="128.375">Credit Cost</th><th>Description &#x26; Usage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prompt Enhancement</strong></td><td>+<strong>0.5 credits</strong> per prompt</td><td><em><strong>Enhance Prompt</strong></em><strong> ‚Äì</strong> Uses an AI language model to refine or expand your text prompt before image generation. This optional step can make prompts more descriptive or creative. It costs a half-credit per use.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1x Image Upscaling</strong></td><td>+<strong>1 credit</strong> per upscale</td><td><em><strong>HD Enhancement</strong></em><strong> ‚Äì</strong> Improves image resolution and quality using a super-resolution model (R-ESRGAN). If requested as part of generation, this is counted in the image‚Äôs credit cost (as detailed above).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2x Image Upscaling</strong></td><td>+<strong>2</strong> <strong>credits</strong> per upscale</td><td><em><strong>HD Enhancement</strong></em><strong> ‚Äì</strong> Improves image resolution and quality using a super-resolution model (R-ESRGAN). If requested as part of generation, this is counted in the image‚Äôs credit cost (as detailed above).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NSFW Detection</strong></td><td><strong>Free</strong> (0 credits)</td><td><em><strong>Content Filter</strong></em><strong> ‚Äì</strong> Every image generation is automatically screened for NSFW or disallowed content using a Vision-Transformer classifier. This ensures that <strong>NSFW materials are blocked</strong> and not generated. The NSFW filter does not consume credits. (However, disallowed prompts or outputs will be filtered out, so ensure your prompts comply with content guidelines to avoid wasted requests.)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>isCharacterPreserve</strong></td><td><strong>+5 credits</strong> per prompt</td><td>An additional 5 credits will be deducted when using <code>isCharacterPreserve</code>, since this option requires extra processing to maintain character consistency.</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** *The prompt enhancer and upscaler are optional tools to help you get better results with fewer tries. They incur small credit fees as noted. The NSFW safety filter is built-in for compliance and does not charge credits.*
{% endhint %}

***

### Model Comparison

All three models share the same base credit cost (1 credit per image). Select a model based on your project‚Äôs balance of speed and quality.

<table><thead><tr><th width="125.40625">Model</th><th>Best For</th><th>Pros ‚úÖ</th><th>Cons ‚ö†Ô∏è</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>VeloGen</strong></td><td>Good quality images, Rapid prototyping, quick previews, high-volume generation</td><td>- Fastest generation- Cost-efficient for bulk tasks- Good results even at lower steps</td><td>- Limited detail compared to other models- Best results at lower resolutions (512‚Äì1024px)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NebulaForge XL</strong></td><td>Premium-quality NFT images, detailed artwork, final production</td><td>- Highest image detail &#x26; fidelity- Supports large resolutions (up to 1536px with upscale)- Ideal for production-level quality</td><td>- Slower than VeloGen (especially at high step counts)- Higher steps (26‚Äì50) slightly increase cost (+0.25 credits)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>VisionaryForge</strong></td><td>Premium-quality NFT images, artistic visuals, final production</td><td>- Similar premium quality to NebulaForge XL- Excellent fine detail and color accuracy- Supports high-resolution outputs (up to 1536px)</td><td>- Slower generation times similar to NebulaForge XL- Higher steps (26‚Äì50) slightly increase cost (+0.25 credits)</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

### Credit Purchase Options

ChainGPT Credits (CGPTc) can be purchased directly through the ChainGPT dashboard. **Credits never expire**, and you can buy them on a one-time or recurring basis to suit your integration‚Äôs needs. Key points about purchasing credits:

* **Credit Bundles:** Credits are available in flexible amounts. For example, **1,000 credits cost $10 USD** (since 1 credit = $0.01) ‚Äì you can scale up as needed (e.g. 10,000 credits = $100) or purchase smaller/larger packs in the app. There is no minimum usage fee; you only pay for the credits you need, and you can top-up anytime. *(For enterprise or high-volume needs, larger bulk packages are available.)*
* **Payment Methods:** You can pay via **credit/debit card** or **cryptocurrency**. Supported crypto includes stablecoins like USDT/USDC and popular coins (e.g. ETH, BNB, TRX). Additionally, you may purchase credits using **$CGPT (ChainGPT‚Äôs native token)**. All purchases are processed through the ChainGPT Crypto AI Hub interface for convenience.
* **Discounts for $CGPT or Subscriptions:** If you choose to pay with **$CGPT tokens** *or* if you enable an **automatic monthly credit top-up** subscription, you receive a **15% credit bonus/discount** on those purchases. This means your money goes further (for example, a $100 purchase via $CGPT yields 11,500 credits instead of 10,000). This incentive is designed to reward ecosystem users and those who plan for recurring usage.
* **Monthly Plans:** For organizations or power-users, you can set up a **monthly credits plan** (auto-purchase). This ensures your account is refilled every month with a set number of credits, so your integration never runs out. The 15% discount applies here as well. *(Alternatively, ChainGPT‚Äôs **Freemium** membership ‚Äì achieved by staking CGPT tokens ‚Äì provides a monthly allotment of credits, see Membership docs for details.)*

All credit transactions and balances can be managed via your ChainGPT account dashboard. Credits are deducted in real-time as you make API/SDK calls, and you can monitor usage in the dashboard to plan when to top-up.

***

### Best Practices & Tips

Follow these recommendations to efficiently use ChainGPT‚Äôs NFT Generator and maximize your credits:

**1. Optimize Prompts with Enhancement:** Before generating images repeatedly, use the **Prompt Enhancement** tool (1 credit). It helps create detailed, effective prompts on your first try, reducing unnecessary spending.

**2. Prototype Quickly with VeloGen:** Start initial tests and bulk generations with **VeloGen** (1 credit per image). It's fast and cost-effective, allowing quick iteration. Once satisfied, switch to **NebulaForge XL** or **VisionaryForge** for high-quality final outputs.

**3. Use Image Upscaling Strategically:** Only use upscaling (enhancement) when higher resolution or improved clarity is essential. For drafts or previews, skip enhancement to save credits. Apply **1√ó Upscale** for improved quality or **2√ó Upscale** for exceptional detail and resolution.

**4. Adhere to Content Guidelines:** Ensure prompts follow content guidelines to avoid blocked generations. Non-compliant prompts may still consume credits without producing results. Use clear, appropriate, family-friendly prompts.

**5. Track Usage Regularly:** Monitor your credit usage via the ChainGPT dashboard. Regular tracking helps you manage credits effectively and anticipate future needs. For consistent usage, set up automatic monthly top-ups to benefit from a 15% discount.

**6. Validate with Samples Before Bulk Generation:** When creating large NFT collections, always generate a small sample batch first. Validate prompt effectiveness and style consistency before committing credits to large-scale generation, ensuring your final batch meets your expectations.

{% hint style="info" %}
By applying these best practices, you‚Äôll achieve optimal results and predictable costs while making the most of ChainGPT‚Äôs powerful NFT generation tools.

# QuickStart Guide

## ChainGPT Smart Contract Generator ‚Äì QuickStart Guide

This quickstart will help you integrate ChainGPT‚Äôs **Smart Contract Generator** either via the direct **HTTP API** or using the official **Node.js SDK**. It covers setup steps, authentication, making your first request, handling streaming vs. complete responses, using chat history, and important best practices. Follow the guide below to get up and running quickly and confidently.

***

### API QuickStart

The **Smart Contract Generator API** allows you to access ChainGPT‚Äôs contract generation engine over HTTP, without installing any SDK. This is ideal for using the service from any backend environment or language that can make HTTP requests.

#### Prerequisites

Before calling the API, ensure you have the following prerequisites ready:

* **ChainGPT Account with Credits:** A ChainGPT account on the [ChainGPT WebApp](https://app.chaingpt.org/) with sufficient credits. *Each API call consumes credits, so make sure you have credit balance to avoid interruptions*.
* **API Key:** A secret API key associated with your account. You can generate one from the WebApp‚Äôs API dashboard. (See **Getting an API Key** below.)
* **Environment to make requests:** For example, a command-line tool like `curl` or an API client (Postman), or a programming environment (e.g. Node.js with Axios, Python with `requests`, etc.) to send HTTP requests.
* **Operating System:** Any OS with internet access (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.).

#### Getting an API Key

To obtain your API key for authentication:

1. **Log in to ChainGPT WebApp:** Go to [**app.chaingpt.org**](https://app.chaingpt.org/) and sign in to your account (create an account if you haven‚Äôt already).
2. **Navigate to API Dashboard:** Find the **API Dashboard** or **API Keys** section in the web application.
3. **Create a Secret Key:** Click on ‚ÄúCreate Secret Key‚Äù (or similar) to generate a new API key. Give it an identifiable name if prompted.
4. **Copy the API Key:** Once generated, copy the API key. **Store it securely** ‚Äì you‚Äôll need it for API calls.

{% hint style="info" %}
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Treat your API key like a password. **Do not expose it** in client-side code, public repos, or anywhere insecure. It‚Äôs recommended to store the key in an environment variable or secure secrets manager, and load it in your application at runtime rather than hard-coding it in code.
{% endhint %}

Ensure your ChainGPT account has credits before proceeding. The API uses a credit system: **1 credit is deducted per API request**, plus an **additional 1 credit** if you enable chat history for that request. If you have no credits, calls to the API will fail. (You can purchase or earn credits in the WebApp as needed.)

#### Authentication and Endpoint

The Smart Contract Generator API uses simple **Bearer token** authentication with your API key. All requests should include an HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.

The base endpoint for generating smart contracts via chat is:

```
POST https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream
```

**Request Headers:**

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required) ‚Äì Use the API key obtained above. (Always prefix it with the word ‚ÄúBearer ‚Äù and a space).
* `Content-Type: application/json` ‚Äì Ensure you send JSON if using raw HTTP (most HTTP libraries set this automatically when sending a JSON body).

**Request Body Parameters:** (JSON)

* `model` (string, **required**): The model name to use. For this API, use `"smart_contract_generator"`.
* `question` (string, **required**): The user‚Äôs prompt or question. For example, *‚ÄúWrite a Solidity smart contract for a simple counter.‚Äù*
* `chatHistory` (string, optional): `"on"` or `"off"`. Set to `"on"` to enable chat history (conversation memory) for this request; `"off"` for a single-turn query. *(See **Chat History** below for details.)*
* `sdkUniqueId` (string, optional): A unique user or session identifier, used when chat history is on. This ensures the chat history is tied to a specific user or session for continuity. If you‚Äôre just doing a one-off call, you can omit this.

**Example Request:** If you use `curl`, a basic example might look like (replace `<API_KEY>` with your key):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "smart_contract_generator", "question": "Generate a smart contract for a sum of two numbers."}'
```

This will initiate a request to generate a smart contract based on your prompt.

#### Making Your First API Call

Let‚Äôs walk through making a request using Node.js for illustration. You can adapt the logic to your preferred language or tool.

First, set up an HTTP client. In Node.js, you might use **Axios** for convenience:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

// Load configuration from environment (for security, avoid hard‚Äëcoding)
const API_URL = 'https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream';
const API_KEY = process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY;   // set your key in an env var

// Create an Axios instance with the base URL, auth header, and streaming mode
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_URL,
  timeout: 60000,              // 60‚Äësecond timeout
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` },
  responseType: 'stream'       // ‚≠êÔ∏è this makes response.data a readable stream
});
```

With the client ready, you can **send a POST request** to the endpoint. Below, we send a prompt and handle the response as a stream:

```javascript
try {
  const response = await apiClient.post('/', {
    model: 'smart_contract_generator',
    question: 'Write a smart contract that counts. It will have two functions: one to increment, and another to decrement.'
  });
  
  // The response is streamed chunk by chunk
  response.data.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk.toString());  // print each piece of the contract as it arrives
  });
  response.data.on('end', () => {
    console.log("Stream ended");
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error("API request failed:", error);
}
```

In this example, the API will start **streaming** the generated smart contract code back. We attach handlers to process each `data` chunk as it arrives, and to know when the stream has ended. This streaming approach is useful for showing partial results to users in real-time or handling very large outputs without loading everything in memory.

**Getting the complete response at once:** If you prefer to wait for the full result rather than streaming, you can adjust the request. For instance, remove the streaming response handling and let the request complete normally. In Axios, you could omit the `responseType: "stream"` configuration (or use the default). For example:

```javascript
// Using the same apiClient instance, but force a JSON (non‚Äëstream) response
const fullResponse = await apiClient.post(
  '/',
  {
    model: 'smart_contract_generator',
    question: 'Write a smart contract that counts with increment and decrement functions.'
  },
  { responseType: 'json' }   // <- override the client default
);

console.log(fullResponse.data);
```

This will wait until the smart contract generation is finished and then log the entire response body at once. The response data typically includes the generated contract text (and any metadata) in one complete payload. This mode is handy if you just want the final result and don‚Äôt need to stream intermediate output.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Alternatively, create a separate Axios instance without the `responseType: 'stream'` configuration for blob‚Äëstyle requests.
{% endhint %}

#### Chat History and Session Management

One powerful feature of the Smart Contract Generator is the ability to maintain context across multiple interactions. By enabling **chat history**, you allow the model to remember previous questions and answers, which can be useful for follow-up queries or iterative development.

* **Enabling Chat History:** To turn on conversation memory, set `"chatHistory": "on"` in your request body. When enabled, the system will log the conversation so that subsequent requests can include prior context.
* Using `sdkUniqueId` : When chat history is on, it‚Äôs recommended to provide an `sdkUniqueId` ‚Äì a unique identifier for the user or session. This ensures that the history is tied to that ID. For example, you might use a user‚Äôs UUID or session ID from your application. That way, if multiple users or separate sessions use the API, their histories won‚Äôt mix together.

**Example (API request with chat history):**

```javascript
await apiClient.post('/', {
  model: 'smart_contract_generator',
  question: 'Now add a reset function to the counter contract.',
  chatHistory: 'on',
  sdkUniqueId: 'user-12345'  // unique identifier for the user or session
});
```

If this call is made after the previous prompt (and uses the same `sdkUniqueId`), the API will remember the earlier contract it generated and the new request will be answered in that context (e.g. adding to the same contract code).

When `chatHistory` is `"on"`, each API call will **store the Q\&A** internally. You can retrieve the saved conversations if needed:

* **Retrieve Chat History (API):** There is an endpoint to fetch past chat entries: `GET https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/chatHistory`. It supports query parameters like `limit`, `offset`, `sortBy`, and `sortOrder` to page through history. For example, you could do:

  ```javascript
  // Assuming API_URL is set to https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/chatHistory for this request
  const historyClient = axios.create({
    baseURL: 'https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/chatHistory',
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
  });
  const historyResponse = await historyClient.get('/', {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0,
    sortBy: 'createdAt',
    sortOrder: 'desc'
  });
  console.log(historyResponse.data.data.rows);
  ```

  This would fetch the 10 most recent chat history records (including prompts and responses).

**Note:** When using chat history, remember that **each request with `chatHistory: "on"` costs an extra credit** (since the service is storing and maintaining context). However, fetching the history via the `chatHistory` endpoint does **not** consume extra credits (you already paid when saving the history).

If you do not need conversation context or follow-ups, you can keep `chatHistory: "off"` (or omit the field). This will treat each request independently.

#### Credit Usage and Rate Limits

ChainGPT‚Äôs API is credit-based and has usage limits to ensure fair use:

* **Credit Consumption:** Every call to the smart contract generator API **deducts 1 credit** from your account. If you enable chat history (`"chatHistory": "on"`), an **additional 1 credit** is deducted for that request (so 2 credits total for that call).
* **Rate Limits:** To prevent abuse, there is a rate limit of **200 requests per minute** per account. If you exceed this, subsequent requests may be throttled or rejected. Design your application to stay within this limit (e.g., by queueing or spacing out calls if needed).
* **Error Handling for Limits:** If you hit the rate limit or run out of credits, the API will return an error (HTTP 4xx/5xx). Make sure to handle such responses in your code (see **Error Handling** below).

Keep an eye on your credit balance via the WebApp dashboard. Credits may be purchased or obtained through ChainGPT‚Äôs platform. **üí° Note:** The credit policy (cost per request) may be updated over time, so always refer to the latest information on the ChainGPT WebApp for any changes.

#### Error Handling and Best Practices

When integrating the API, follow these best practices to build a robust and secure application:

* **Use Environment Variables for Secrets:** As mentioned, never hard-code your API key in your codebase. Use environment variables (e.g., `process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY`) or a secret management system to inject the key at runtime. This prevents accidental exposure of the key in version control or client-side code.
* **Wrap API Calls in Error Handling:** Network issues or API errors (like invalid parameters or insufficient credits) can occur. Always use try/catch (for async calls) or handle promise rejections when calling the API. For example, in Node/Axios:

  ```javascript
  try {
    const response = await apiClient.post(...);
    // process response
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("API call failed:", err.response ? err.response.data : err.message);
  }
  ```

  Check the error response for details (status code, message) to implement retries or user messaging as appropriate.
* **Security (Server-Side Calls):** Ideally, call the ChainGPT API from your backend server, not directly from client-side applications. This keeps your API key hidden from end-users. If you must call from a client (not recommended), consider proxying through your server or using other secure delegation methods.
* **Validate Inputs:** Ensure that the prompts (`question` field) sent to the API are validated or sanitized as needed by your application context, especially if they come from end-users, to avoid misuse or unintended content requests.
* **Monitor Usage:** Implement logging around your API calls. Log remaining credits (if the API returns that info via headers or response) or count calls to anticipate when you need to top-up credits. Also handle the scenario where the API key is revoked or becomes invalid (the API would return an unauthorized error).

By following these practices, you‚Äôll maintain secure access and handle common issues gracefully.

***

### SDK QuickStart

If you are using a Node.js environment, the **ChainGPT Smart Contract Generator SDK** provides a convenient wrapper around the API. The SDK handles HTTP calls under the hood and provides a cleaner interface, plus built-in error types. This section will guide you through installing and using the SDK in a project.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the SDK, make sure you have:

* **Node.js runtime:** The SDK supports JavaScript/TypeScript in a Node.js environment. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system (SDK is not intended for use in browsers).
* **NPM or Yarn:** You‚Äôll use a package manager to install the SDK package.
* **ChainGPT Account, API Key, and Credits:** As with the API, you need a ChainGPT account with an API key (secret key) and available credits. Generate a key via the WebApp‚Äôs API Dashboard if you haven‚Äôt already (refer back to **Getting an API Key** in the API section). Keep the API key ready for use in your code, and ensure your account has credits (each SDK call will consume credits just like the API).

#### Installation

Install the ChainGPT Smart Contract Generator SDK via npm or yarn:

```javascript
npm install --save @chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator
# or
yarn add @chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator
```

This will add the SDK library to your Node.js project. The SDK is published on NPM as **`@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator`**.

#### Initialization and Configuration

After installing, import the SDK and initialize it with your API key. For example:

```javascript
import { SmartContractGenerator } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator";

const smartcontractgenerator = new SmartContractGenerator({
  apiKey: process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY  // Your ChainGPT API Key (use env var for security)
});
```

This creates a `smartcontractgenerator` client instance configured with your API key. The `apiKey` is required for authentication. *(As a best practice, load it from an environment variable rather than embedding the literal key.)*

Behind the scenes, the SDK uses this key to authenticate to the ChainGPT API on your behalf. Make sure the key is valid and has credits associated with it.

#### Making Your First SDK Request

With the SDK client ready, you can now generate smart contracts. The SDK provides two main methods to create a smart contract answer from a prompt:

* **`createSmartContractStream(options)`** ‚Äì for streaming responses (chunk-by-chunk).
* **`createSmartContractBlob(options)`** ‚Äì for a complete response (all at once, as a ‚Äúblob‚Äù of data).

Both methods take an `options` object where you specify at least a `question` (the prompt). Other options include `chatHistory` and `sdkUniqueId` (just like the API parameters).

**Example 1: Quick one-off generation (Blob response)** ‚Äì This will get the full response at once:

```javascript
import { SmartContractGenerator } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator";

const smartcontractgenerator = new SmartContractGenerator({ apiKey: process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY });

async function generateContract() {
  try {
    const result = await smartcontractgenerator.createSmartContractBlob({
      question: "Write a smart contract that counts. It will have two functions: increment and decrement.",
      chatHistory: "off"  // no chat history for this single request
    });
    // The result contains the AI's answer including the contract code
    console.log(result.data.bot);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating contract:", error);
  }
}

generateContract();
```

In this snippet, we call `createSmartContractBlob` with a prompt. The response (`result`) contains a `data` object, and the generated contract text is in `result.data.bot`. We log it to verify the output. If there‚Äôs an error (e.g., no credits or network issue), it gets caught and logged.

**Example 2: Streaming response** ‚Äì If you want to receive the response incrementally (useful for progress updates or interactive apps):

```javascript
async function generateContractStream() {
  try {
    const stream = await smartcontractgenerator.createSmartContractStream({
      question: "Write a smart contract that counts with increment and decrement functions.",
      chatHistory: "off"
    });
    stream.on('data', (chunk) => {
      console.log(chunk.toString());  // print each chunk of the contract as it streams in
    });
    stream.on('end', () => {
      console.log("Stream ended");
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Streaming request failed:", error);
  }
}

generateContractStream();
```

Here we use `createSmartContractStream`. It returns a Node.js stream. We attach listeners to handle the incoming `data` events (converting each chunk to string and printing it) and an `end` event to know when the stream is complete. This way, you can start processing or displaying parts of the contract before the entire output is ready.

Both methods (`createSmartContractBlob` and `...Stream`) ultimately achieve the same result ‚Äì generating a contract from a prompt ‚Äì but streaming can improve responsiveness for large outputs. Under the hood, the SDK takes care of calling the appropriate API endpoint and handling the HTTP details.

#### Using Chat History in the SDK

The SDK also supports multi-turn interactions via chat history, similar to the raw API:

* To enable conversation memory, pass `chatHistory: "on"` in the options.
* Provide a unique `sdkUniqueId` in the options to identify the user/session whose history should be used.

**Example:** Continuation with chat history.

```javascript
const userId = "907208eb-0929-42c3-a372-c21934fbf44f";  // unique ID for the user or session

async function askFollowUp() {
  try {
    const followUp = await smartcontractgenerator.createSmartContractBlob({
      question: "Now add a reset function to the counter contract.",
      chatHistory: "on",
      sdkUniqueId: userId
    });
    console.log(followUp.data.bot);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error with follow-up question:", error);
  }
}

askFollowUp();
```

In this example, we use the same `userId` for `sdkUniqueId` as was used in a previous call (not shown) where `chatHistory` was on. The SDK (and underlying API) will retrieve the prior conversation for that ID and use it to inform the answer to the follow-up question. The result is that the new output will be consistent with or build upon the earlier contract.

You can also retrieve the stored chat history via the SDK:

```javascript
async function fetchHistory() {
  try {
    const history = await smartcontractgenerator.getChatHistory({
      limit: 10,
      offset: 0,
      sortBy: "createdAt",
      sortOrder: "DESC"
    });
    console.log(history.data.rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch history:", error);
  }
}

fetchHistory();
```

This uses the `getChatHistory` method to fetch recent chat sessions. The parameters `limit`, `offset`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder` work as in the API, and the response (`history.data.rows`) will contain an array of past interactions (prompts and generated answers) stored for your account.

**Credit usage:** The credit costs for using the SDK are the same as the direct API calls ‚Äì each generation call uses credits (1 or 2 if history is on). Fetching chat history (`getChatHistory`) does not consume extra credits (assuming the history was recorded in earlier calls where you already paid for it).

#### Error Handling in SDK

The SDK is designed to throw errors if something goes wrong (e.g., network issues, invalid API key, not enough credits, etc.), so you should handle these exceptions. Errors from the SDK are instances of the class `SmartContractGeneratorError` (available under `SmartContractGenerator.Errors` if needed).

For example, you can catch errors as follows:

```javascript
import { Errors } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator";

try {
  const stream = await smartcontractgenerator.createSmartContractStream({ /*...*/ });
  // use stream...
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof Errors.SmartContractGeneratorError) {
    console.error("ChainGPT SDK Error:", error.message);
  } else {
    console.error("Unexpected Error:", error);
  }
}
```

In the above, we specifically check if the error is a `SmartContractGeneratorError` (which indicates an issue with the request or API response) and handle it accordingly. You might inspect `error.message` or other properties to decide next steps (for example, prompt the user to check credits or retry later). Always wrap your SDK calls in try/catch since they are asynchronous.

#### Security Considerations

Using the SDK securely involves similar practices to the API:

* **Keep API Keys Secret:** Do not commit your API key in code. Leverage environment variables or configuration files that are not exposed. When instantiating `SmartContractGenerator`, pass the key securely (as shown earlier).
* **Server-side Usage:** Use the SDK on the server side of your application. Avoid including your API key in any client-side (browser) code. The SDK is meant for Node.js, so it typically wouldn‚Äôt run in a browser context anyway.
* **Rate Limiting:** The SDK will not magically bypass rate limits ‚Äì the same **200 requests/minute** limit applies. If you plan to send a high volume of requests, implement checks or throttling in your application logic to stay within limits.
* **Resource Management:** Streaming responses are Node streams ‚Äì be mindful to consume them to completion or handle backpressure if needed. In the examples above, we simply log the chunks; in a real app, you might append them to a file or aggregate them. Make sure to handle the `end` event to know when a stream is fully consumed.
* **Input Sanitization:** Just as with direct API calls, ensure that any prompt coming from users is validated or sanitized if necessary.

By following these security guidelines, you help protect your API key and maintain the reliability of your integration.

With the information in this guide, you should be able to integrate the Smart Contract Generator into your project. Happy coding, and we look forward to seeing what you build with ChainGPT!


# API Reference

## ChainGPT Smart Contract Generator API QuickStart Guide

### Introduction

ChainGPT's **Smart Contract Generator API** is an AI-powered service that generates secure Solidity smart contract code from natural language prompts. This API allows you to integrate on-demand smart contract creation into your applications with simple HTTP requests. It's built on ChainGPT‚Äôs specialized Solidity-trained LLM, so you can get production-ready smart contract code without writing it manually.

***

### Prerequisites & Access

Before using the Smart Contract Generator API, make sure you have the following:

* **ChainGPT Account & Credits:** A ChainGPT account with sufficient credits. Each API call consumes credits (see **Credit Usage** below). You can purchase or earn credits by logging into the ChainGPT app.
* **API Key:** A secret API key obtained from the ChainGPT web app‚Äôs API Dashboard. Log in to the ChainGPT app, navigate to the **API Dashboard**, and use **‚ÄúCreate Secret Key‚Äù** to generate a new key. Copy the key and store it securely. **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Treat your API key like a password ‚Äì do not expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
* **Development Tool:** An environment for making HTTP requests (e.g. a Node.js runtime, cURL, Postman, or similar). No SDK installation is required to use the API directly.

***

### Authentication

All requests to the API must include your API key for authentication. Provide your key in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. For example:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Ensure you use HTTPS for all requests (the endpoint is HTTPS by default) to keep your key and data secure. When sending JSON in the request body, include the header `Content-Type: application/json`.

***

### Base URL

The base URL for the Smart Contract Generator API is:

```
https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream
```

Use the `POST /chat/stream` endpoint to generate a smart contract from a prompt. (There is also a GET endpoint for retrieving chat history, which is covered later, but for contract generation you will use the `/chat/stream` POST endpoint.)

***

### Example Request (Streaming)

Below is an example of calling the API in Node.js using **Axios** to get a streaming response. This example prompt asks for a simple token contract, and we stream the Solidity code as it's generated:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

const API_URL = "https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream";
const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";  // ideally load from an environment variable

try {
  const response = await axios.post(API_URL, {
    model: "smart_contract_generator",
    question: "Write a Solidity smart contract for a token with a name, symbol, and owner-only mint function.",
    chatHistory: "off"
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` },
    responseType: "stream"
  });

  // Stream the response in chunks as they arrive
  response.data.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk.toString());  // output partial contract code chunk by chunk
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error("API call error:", error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
}
```

In this snippet, we send a POST request to the API with our prompt. We set `responseType: "stream"` so that Axios treats the HTTP response as a stream. As the ChainGPT service generates the contract, it will send chunks of the response which we print out immediately. This way, you can start receiving parts of the Solidity code in real-time without waiting for the entire generation to finish. By the end of the stream, you will have the full smart contract code printed to the console.

***

### Request Parameters

When calling the **`POST /chat/stream`** endpoint, include the following JSON fields in the request body:

#### Required Parameters

* **model** (string, **required**): The model name to use. For the Smart Contract Generator API, this **must** be `"smart_contract_generator"` to route your request to the correct AI model.
* **question** (string, **required**): The prompt or instruction describing the smart contract you want. This can be a simple instruction or a detailed specification (e.g. *"Create an ERC-20 token contract with a burn function"*).

#### Optional Parameters

* **chatHistory** (string, optional): `"on"` or `"off"`. Enable this to `"on"` if you want the AI to remember previous prompts and responses (conversation mode). Defaults to `"off"` if not provided. When enabled, the model will consider past Q\&A in this session, allowing iterative refinement of the contract. **Note:** Using chat history will incur an extra credit cost (see **Credit Usage**).
* **sdkUniqueId** (string, optional): A unique identifier for the user session or conversation. This is used to separate chat histories for different sessions or end-users when `chatHistory` is `"on"`. It can be any string (e.g. a user ID or session ID). If not provided, all prompts with history `"on"` under the same API key share the same context. (Despite the name, you can use `sdkUniqueId` in direct API calls as well ‚Äî it‚Äôs essentially a **session ID** for chat context.)

***

### Response Format

On a successful request, the API will return a **200 OK** response containing the generated contract. The response comes in JSON format by default. The important part of the response is the **Solidity code** generated by the AI, which will be included as a string within the JSON structure.

For example, after a complete response, you might receive JSON like this:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "user": "Create an ERC-20 token contract with a burn function.",
    "bot": "pragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyToken {\n    string public name = \"MyToken\";\n    string public symbol = \"MTK\";\n    uint8 public decimals = 18;\n    uint256 public totalSupply;\n    address public owner;\n\n    mapping(address => uint256) balances;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only owner can mint\");\n        totalSupply += amount;\n        balances[to] += amount;\n    }\n\n    function burn(uint256 amount) public {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n        totalSupply -= amount;\n        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;\n    }\n\n    function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {\n        return balances[account];\n    }\n}\n"
  }
}
```

Here, the `"bot"` field (inside the `"data"` object) contains the Solidity smart contract code as a single string, complete with newline characters (). The `"user"` field may echo your prompt, and `"status"` indicates success. In your integration, you'll primarily extract the contract code (the content of `"bot"`).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If you enabled chat history (`"chatHistory": "on"`), the returned content will still just be the current answer (the generated contract for your prompt). The service will have internally logged the Q\&A into the conversation history for future calls, but the response JSON for the generation call remains focused on the prompt and answer at hand.
{% endhint %}

***

### Streaming vs Full Response Modes

By default, the `/chat/stream` endpoint streams its output in chunks, which is great for real-time processing or displaying progress. However, you can also receive the entire response in one go (what we refer to as a "blob" or full response) if you prefer to wait for completion before using the result.

* **Streaming Mode:** (as shown in the example above) ‚Äì You set your HTTP client to stream the response. You will receive pieces of the contract as they are generated. This is useful for large contracts or giving the user immediate feedback. In Axios (Node.js), this is done by setting `responseType: "stream"` and handling the `data` events on the response. In other environments or languages, you might use streaming APIs or Server-Sent Events to achieve similar behavior.
* **Full Response Mode (Blob):** If you do **not** enable streaming on the client side, the API will still work ‚Äì your HTTP client will simply wait until the generation is finished and then give you the complete response. For example, using Axios without the stream option:

  ```javascript
  // Without streaming: get the full response at once
  const res = await axios.post(API_URL, {
    model: "smart_contract_generator",
    question: "Write a Solidity contract for a basic NFT with a mint function.",
    chatHistory: "off"
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
    // no responseType: "stream" here
  });
  // Once the request completes, the entire response is available:
  console.log(res.data);  // the complete Solidity contract code
  ```

  In this mode, the call will return only after the AI has finished generating the contract. The `res.data` will contain the full JSON response, and `res.data` holds the complete contract code. This approach is simpler but has a bit more latency (you wait for the whole answer). It can be suitable for server-side operations where streaming isn't necessary.

Choose the mode that fits your use case: **streaming** for responsiveness or progress updates, vs **full response** for simplicity.

**Get Chat history:**

Smart Contract Generator SDK also stores chat history for future use, which users can retrieve using the following code

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await apiclient.get("/", {
      limit: 10,
      offset: 0,
      sortBy: "createdAt",
      sortOrder: "desc",
    });

    console.log("Response data:", response.data.data.rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
}

// Execute the function to fetch data
fetchData();

```

***

### Credit Usage

The Smart Contract Generator API uses a credit-based model for billing:

* **1 Credit per request:** Each call to generate a contract (each `POST /chat/stream` request) deducts **1 credit** from your ChainGPT account.
* **+1 Credit with chat history:** If you enable `chatHistory: "on"` for a request, an **additional 1 credit** is deducted (so a total of 2 credits for that call). This covers the extra resources needed to maintain and utilize the conversation context.
* **Chat history retrieval:** (Advanced) If you use the separate history endpoint to fetch past conversations (`GET /chat/chatHistory`), retrieving chat history does **not** consume extra credits (it was already charged when you enabled `chatHistory` during generation).

Make sure your account has enough credits before making requests, otherwise the API will refuse calls due to insufficient balance. You can check and top up your credits on the ChainGPT web app. *(Credit pricing is designed to be low per call ‚Äî usually on the order of cents per contract ‚Äî but refer to the official pricing page for the latest details.)*

***

### Security & Rate Limits

When integrating the API, keep these security and usage limits in mind:

* **API Key Security:** Always keep your API key secret. **Do not** embed it in client-side applications (browser or mobile code) where it could be exposed. Instead, make API calls from a secure backend server or other secure environment. If you suspect your key is compromised, revoke it in the dashboard and generate a new one.
* **HTTPS Only:** Always use the HTTPS endpoint (`https://api.chaingpt.org`) for all requests. This ensures all data (your prompts and the generated code) is encrypted in transit.
* **Rate Limits:** Each API key is limited to **200 requests per minute**. This generous limit prevents abuse and ensures stability. If you exceed this rate, the API will return HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" errors. Plan your usage accordingly (e.g., queue or throttle calls if needed). If you consistently need a higher rate, consider using multiple API keys or contact ChainGPT support for enterprise options.
* **Input Validation:** The API will attempt to handle a wide range of prompts, but it's good practice to sanitize or validate any untrusted user input you send as a prompt, especially if you might use the output in sensitive contexts.

By following these guidelines, you ensure secure and efficient usage of the Smart Contract Generator API.

***

With the above, you should be able to quickly start integrating smart contract generation into your app!


# SDK Reference

## ChainGPT Smart-Contracts Generator SDK Reference

### Introduction

The **ChainGPT Smart-Contracts Generator SDK** is a Node.js library that allows developers to programmatically generate Solidity smart contract code using natural language prompts. It provides convenient access to ChainGPT‚Äôs AI-powered Smart Contract Generator service via simple JavaScript/TypeScript methods, without needing to handle raw HTTP requests. Using this SDK, you can integrate automated smart contract creation into your applications, tools, or workflows with minimal setup.

**Key features:**

* **Ease of Use:** Initialize the SDK with your API key and call a method with a plain English prompt to receive a ready-to-use smart contract. No deep AI or blockchain expertise is required.
* **Two Generation Modes:** Choose between receiving the full contract output in one response (a ‚Äúblob‚Äù result), or streaming the contract code progressively as it‚Äôs generated in real-time.
* **Chat History Support:** Optionally enable chat history to allow multi-turn interactions (iteratively refining contracts) and retrieve past generation sessions.
* **Secure & Scalable:** Authentication is handled via API keys, with support for up to 200 requests per minute per key. The service uses a credit-based system for pricing (typically 1 credit per generation request, see **Credit Usage** below), ensuring predictable costs.

**Prerequisites:** To use the SDK, you need a Node.js environment (JavaScript or TypeScript) and an active ChainGPT account with API access. Make sure you have: Node.js installed, a ChainGPT API Key, and available credits in your ChainGPT account.

***

### Installation

Install the SDK package via npm or Yarn:

```
npm install --save @chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator
# or
yarn add @chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator
```

This will add the ChainGPT Smart-Contract Generator SDK to your project. The library is distributed with TypeScript type declarations, so it can be used in both JavaScript and TypeScript projects. The SDK supports **Node.js** environments (it is not intended for direct use in browsers).

***

### Setup and Authentication

Before using the SDK, you must obtain a **ChainGPT API Key** and ensure your account has sufficient credits:

* **Obtain API Key:** Log in to the ChainGPT web app ([**app.chaingpt.org**](https://app.chaingpt.org/)) and navigate to the API Dashboard. Use the interface to create a new *Secret Key* (API key) and copy it. Each key is a secret token that authenticates your requests to the ChainGPT API.
* **Credits:** ChainGPT uses a credit-based system. Ensure your account has credits available (you can purchase or earn credits on the ChainGPT platform). Each API call via the SDK will deduct credits from your account (see **Credit Usage** below).

**Authentication:** Once you have your API key, provide it when initializing the SDK. For security, **do not hard-code** the key in your codebase. Instead, store it in an environment variable or secure config and pass it in at runtime. For example:

```javascript
import { SmartContractGenerator } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator";

// Load API key from environment for security
const apiKey = process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY as string; 

// Initialize the SmartContractGenerator SDK client
const smartcontractgenerator = new SmartContractGenerator({
  apiKey: apiKey,  // your ChainGPT API Key
});
```

*Never expose your API Key publicly.* Treat it like a password: commit it to a secure store or environment variable rather than hardcoding. The SDK will use this key to authenticate all requests.

***

### Usage Overview

The ChainGPT Smart-Contracts Generator SDK provides three primary methods to interact with the service:

* **`createSmartContractBlob`** ‚Äì Generate a smart contract and get the entire result in one response (a ‚Äúblob‚Äù of data).
* **`createSmartContractStream`** ‚Äì Generate a smart contract and receive the output as a stream of data chunks, allowing you to handle partial results in real-time (useful for progress updates or large contracts).
* **`getChatHistory`** ‚Äì Retrieve the history of past smart contract generation requests and responses (if chat history was enabled for those requests).

All methods are available on the `smartcontractgenerator` instance created above. In the sections below, each method is detailed with its parameters, return format, example usage, and notes on credit consumption.

#### `createSmartContractBlob(options)`

Generates a new smart contract based on a natural-language prompt, returning the full contract code in a single response object. Use this method when you prefer to receive the complete result at once (for example, in a server-side script or when the final output size is manageable).

**Parameters:** (pass as an object to the method)

* **`question`** (`string`, required): The prompt or query describing the desired smart contract. This can be any natural-language instruction, e.g. *"Create an ERC-20 token contract with a mint function"*.
* **`chatHistory`** (`"on"` or `"off"` , required): Set to `"on"` to enable chat history for this request, or `"off"` to treat it as a one-off request. When `"on"`, the conversation history will be stored and used to inform the response (allowing follow-up questions). When `"off"`, the AI will not reference any prior context, and no history will be saved.
* **`sdkUniqueId`** (`string`, optional): A unique identifier for the user or session. Only needed if `chatHistory` is `"on"`. By providing a stable unique ID (such as a user ID or UUID) for each user/session, you ensure the chat history is kept separate per user. Use the **same** `sdkUniqueId` for subsequent calls to continue the conversation thread of a particular user (see **Chat History & Session Management** below). If not provided, the history will be tracked globally per API key (not separated by user).

**Returns:** A **Promise** that resolves to a response object containing the generated contract. On success, you can access the contract code string in `response.data.bot`. The response may include additional metadata (such as IDs or timestamps) as part of the data. On failure, the promise will reject with an error (see **Error Handling**).

**Example ‚Äì Blob Response:**

```javascript
import { SmartContractGenerator } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator";

const smartcontractgenerator = new SmartContractGenerator({ apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>" });

async function main() {
  try {
    const response = await smartcontractgenerator.createSmartContractBlob({
      question: "Write a smart contract that counts. It will have two functions: one for incrementing, other for decrementing.",
      chatHistory: "off"
    });
    console.log("Generated contract code:\n", response.data.bot);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating contract:", error);
  }
}

main();
```

In this example, `createSmartContractBlob` sends the prompt to ChainGPT and waits for the full contract code to be returned. We then log the `response.data.bot` field, which contains the Solidity code generated by the AI. Because `chatHistory` is set to `"off"`, this request will not be associated with any persistent history and only **1 credit** will be consumed for the API call.

**Credit Usage:** Each call to `createSmartContractBlob` deducts **1 credit** from your ChainGPT account. If you enable chat history for the request (`chatHistory: "on"`), an **additional 1 credit** will be deducted to store and maintain the conversation history. (See **Chat History & Session Management** for details on when to use this.)

#### `createSmartContractStream(options)`

Generates a new smart contract based on a prompt, returning the result as a streaming response. This method is useful for getting real-time feedback or updating a UI as the contract is being generated. The AI‚Äôs output will be sent in chunks through a Node.js stream interface.

**Parameters:** *Identical to `createSmartContractBlob`:*

* **`question`** (`string`, required): The natural-language description of the smart contract you want.
* **`chatHistory`** (`"on"` or `"off"`, required): Enable or disable using/storing chat history for this generation (same behavior as described above).
* **`sdkUniqueId`** (`string`, optional): Unique session/user ID (only needed if `chatHistory` is `"on"`, to isolate this conversation‚Äôs history).

**Returns:** A **Promise** that resolves to a Node.js **Readable stream**. The stream will emit data events with chunks of the contract code as they are generated. You can listen to the stream‚Äôs `'data'` event to process output incrementally, and a `'end'` event to know when generation is complete. If the request fails initially, the promise will reject with an error instead of returning a stream.

**Example ‚Äì Streaming Response:**

```javascript
import { SmartContractGenerator } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator";

const smartcontractgenerator = new SmartContractGenerator({ apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>" });

async function main() {
  try {
    const stream = await smartcontractgenerator.createSmartContractStream({
      question: "Write a smart contract that counts. It will have two functions: one for incrementing, other for decrementing.",
      chatHistory: "off"
    });
    // Handle the stream events
    stream.on('data', (chunk: any) => {
      const partialOutput = chunk.toString();
      console.log("Received chunk:", partialOutput);
    });
    stream.on('end', () => {
      console.log("Stream ended - contract generation complete.");
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error starting stream:", error);
  }
}

main();
```

In this example, `createSmartContractStream` returns a stream, and we set up listeners for `'data'` and `'end'` events. As the contract is generated, chunks of text (Solidity code) will be printed out in real-time. This is useful for providing progress feedback to users. We have used `chatHistory: "off"` here for a single-turn generation (consuming 1 credit). You could set it to `"on"` (with a corresponding `sdkUniqueId` if needed) to enable context continuity, at the cost of an extra credit for history.

**Credit Usage:** Each call to `createSmartContractStream` also costs **1 credit** (plus **1 additional credit** if `chatHistory: "on"` is used). Streaming a response or getting a blob both incur the same credit cost for the request; the difference is only in how the data is delivered.

#### `getChatHistory(options)`

Retrieves the history of past smart-contract generation interactions (prompts and responses) associated with your API key, especially those where chat history was enabled. This allows you to review or display previous contracts generated, or to fetch the context for follow-up questions in an ongoing session.

**Parameters:** (pass as an object)

* **`limit`** (`number`, optional): The maximum number of history entries to retrieve. For example, `10` to get the 10 most recent entries. (Defaults may apply if not specified, e.g. 10 or 20 by default.)
* **`offset`** (`number`, optional): The number of entries to skip (useful for pagination). For instance, an offset of `0` starts from the most recent entry, `10` would skip the first ten entries, etc.
* **`sortBy`** (`string`, optional): Field by which to sort the history entries. The default (and typical) field is `"createdAt"` (the timestamp of creation).
* **`sortOrder`** (`string`, optional): Sort direction, either `"ASC"` for ascending or `"DESC"` for descending. For example, to get newest first, use `"DESC"` (which is likely the default if not specified).

**Returns:** A **Promise** that resolves to a response object containing the history records. On success, the history entries are typically found in `response.data.rows` (as an array). Each entry may include information such as the prompt/question, the generated contract (or a reference to it), timestamps, and possibly the `sdkUniqueId` if one was used. If no history is available (e.g., if you never enabled `chatHistory` in prior calls), the returned list may be empty. If the request fails (e.g., due to invalid parameters or network issues), the promise will reject with an error.

**Example ‚Äì Retrieving History:**

```javascript
import { SmartContractGenerator } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator";

const smartcontractgenerator = new SmartContractGenerator({ apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>" });

async function main() {
  try {
    const historyResponse = await smartcontractgenerator.getChatHistory({
      limit: 10,
      offset: 0,
      sortBy: "createdAt",
      sortOrder: "DESC"
    });
    const historyEntries = historyResponse.data.rows;
    console.log("Retrieved history entries:", historyEntries);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching chat history:", error);
  }
}

main();
```

This example fetches up to 10 previous smart contract generations (most recent first). The result `historyEntries` would contain the stored history records. You can iterate over these to inspect past prompts and results. Typically, you would call `getChatHistory` to support features like showing a user their past generated contracts or to retrieve a conversation‚Äôs context for further processing.

**Credit Usage:** **No additional credits** are deducted when retrieving chat history. The history entries are stored as a result of prior calls that had `chatHistory` enabled, which is when the extra credit was charged. Therefore, calling `getChatHistory` itself does not consume credits beyond those already spent to record the history. (If none of your previous calls had `chatHistory` turned on, you will have no history to retrieve.)

***

### Chat History & Session Management

Enabling **chat history** allows the ChainGPT Smart-Contracts Generator to remember previous interactions, enabling context-aware conversations. This can be useful if you want to ask follow-up questions or iterative refinements to a contract. For example, you might first ask for a basic contract, then ask the AI to add a feature to the last contract. When `chatHistory` is `"on"`, the model can utilize previous prompts and responses for better results.

**Using `chatHistory`:** To turn on history for a generation request, set `chatHistory: "on"` in the options for `createSmartContractBlob` or `createSmartContractStream`. This will store the prompt and response from that request in the ChainGPT backend. Subsequent calls with history enabled can then reference prior context. If `chatHistory` is `"off"`, each request is handled independently with no memory of earlier prompts.

**Session isolation with `sdkUniqueId`:** When building applications with multiple users or multiple concurrent sessions, it‚Äôs important to keep each conversation‚Äôs history separate. The SDK provides the `sdkUniqueId` parameter for this purpose. You should assign a unique identifier (e.g., a user ID or a randomly generated UUID) for each user or session, and pass that same `sdkUniqueId` value in every request where `chatHistory` is `"on"` for that user. This ensures the chat history stored for one user/session is not mixed with another. In other words, `sdkUniqueId` defines a scope for the conversation history.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If you omit `sdkUniqueId` while using `chatHistory: "on"`, all history-enabled requests under your API key will be lumped into a single default history. This may not be desirable if multiple distinct conversations are happening. It‚Äôs recommended to always use a unique ID for each independent history you want to maintain.
{% endhint %}

**Example ‚Äì Managing Chat History with a Unique ID:**

```javascript
import { SmartContractGenerator } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator";

const smartcontractgenerator = new SmartContractGenerator({ apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>" });

// Suppose you have a unique identifier for the user or session:
const userSessionId = "907208eb-0929-42c3-a372-c21934fbf44f";  // example UUID

async function main() {
  try {
    const response = await smartcontractgenerator.createSmartContractBlob({
      question: "Now add a reset function that sets the count back to zero.", 
      chatHistory: "on",
      sdkUniqueId: userSessionId
    });
    console.log("Refined contract code:\n", response.data.bot);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating contract with history:", error);
  }
}

main();
```

In this snippet, we continue a conversation by asking the AI to "add a reset function" to the contract. We use `chatHistory: "on"` and provide the same `sdkUniqueId` (e.g., the user‚Äôs UUID) that was used in previous requests for this user. The ChainGPT service will lookup the prior context associated with that `sdkUniqueId` and include it when generating the new response. The result is a refined contract that builds upon the earlier output. Each history-enabled call costs an extra credit (to store the interaction) as noted in **Credit Usage**.

You can retrieve the entire conversation later with `getChatHistory`, which will include all prompts and responses for that `sdkUniqueId` (and also global history entries if any). This allows for persistent session logs or auditing of AI-generated content.

***

### Error Handling

The SDK is designed to throw informative errors when something goes wrong ‚Äì for example, network issues, invalid inputs, or API errors (like authentication failure or rate limit exceeded). All such errors are thrown as instances of the class `SmartContractGeneratorError`. You can import this error class via the `Errors` namespace provided by the SDK and use it to distinguish ChainGPT SDK errors from other exceptions.

**Example ‚Äì Handling errors with try/catch:**

```javascript
import { SmartContractGenerator, Errors } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractgenerator";

const smartcontractgenerator = new SmartContractGenerator({ apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>" });

async function main() {
  try {
    // Attempt a streaming call (this example might fail if, say, the API key is invalid or network is down)
    const stream = await smartcontractgenerator.createSmartContractStream({
      question: "Write a smart contract that counts...",
      chatHistory: "on"
      // (sdkUniqueId omitted for brevity; in a real app include it if using history)
    });
    stream.on('data', chunk => console.log(chunk.toString()));
    stream.on('end', () => console.log("Stream ended"));
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Errors.SmartContractGeneratorError) {
      // Handle known SDK error (e.g., API returned an error or connection failed)
      console.error("ChainGPT SDK error:", error.message);
    } else {
      // Handle other unexpected errors
      console.error("Unexpected error:", error);
    }
  }
}

main();
```

In the above example, we wrap the call in a `try/catch` block. If an error occurs during the `createSmartContractStream` request (for instance, a 401 Unauthorized due to a bad API key, or a network timeout), the SDK will throw an `Errors.SmartContractGeneratorError`. We check for that specifically, and log the error message. If the error was not from the ChainGPT SDK (which is unlikely in this context, but good practice), it falls to the generic case. The `error.message` typically contains a human-readable description of what went wrong (for example, "Invalid API key" or "Rate limit exceeded"), which you can use for debugging or user feedback.

**Common error scenarios to handle:**

* *Authentication errors:* If your API key is invalid or expired, the SDK will throw an error indicating authentication failed. Obtain a valid key and ensure it‚Äôs correctly configured.
* *Insufficient credits:* If your account lacks credits, calls to the API will fail. The error message will inform you if you need to top up credits.
* *Rate limit exceeded:* Exceeding the allowed request rate (200 requests per minute) will result in errors. You may need to throttle your requests if you hit this limit.
* *Network issues:* Temporary network problems or server unavailability can cause request failures. These should be transient ‚Äì you can catch and retry the request after a delay as needed.

By handling `SmartContractGeneratorError`, you can implement robust error recovery or user messaging in your application.

***

### Language and Environment Support

The Smart-Contracts Generator SDK is currently supported for **Node.js** environments and is written in TypeScript. This means you can use it in any JavaScript or TypeScript project running on Node.js (backend services, scripts, etc.). The package is distributed with type definitions, so you get IntelliSense and compile-time type checking if you use TypeScript.

* **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+) and TypeScript are fully supported. Because it‚Äôs an npm package, you can also use it with bundlers or frameworks as long as it runs server-side.
* **Platform:** Node.js (LTS versions recommended). The SDK uses Node-compatible modules for HTTP requests. It is not tested for browser use, and using it in front-end web applications is not advised (both for security of the API key and CORS reasons).
* **Compatibility:** No specific framework is required ‚Äì you can integrate it in a Node environment of your choice (Express, Next.js server-side, scripts, etc.). Ensure that your Node version is relatively up-to-date to support modern JS features.

In summary, if you have Node.js and an internet connection, the SDK should work out-of-the-box on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

***

### Security Best Practices & Rate Limits

Using the ChainGPT SDK in a production application requires mindful handling of credentials and adherence to usage policies:

* **API Key Security:** As emphasized, keep your ChainGPT API key secret. Do not embed it in client-side code or public repositories. Use environment variables or a secrets management service to inject the key into your app at runtime. This prevents malicious actors from stealing your key and consuming your credits.
* **Least Privilege:** Only generate and use API keys when needed. You might rotate keys periodically or revoke any that are compromised. Monitor your credit usage in the ChainGPT dashboard for any unexpected activity.
* **Request Rate Limiting:** The ChainGPT API (and by extension the SDK) enforces a rate limit of **200 requests per minute** per API key. If you exceed this, further requests may be rejected until the rate window resets. Design your application to stay within this limit ‚Äì e.g., by queuing or spacing out non-urgent requests, or by distributing load across multiple API keys if absolutely necessary (and allowed by ChainGPT‚Äôs terms).
* **Credit Usage:** Every generation request costs credits (usually 1 credit, plus 1 more if using history). Make sure your account has enough credits for the workload you expect. The SDK does not currently provide a built-in way to check your credit balance, so you might need to track usage or periodically check the ChainGPT web dashboard. If a request fails due to insufficient credits, you‚Äôll need to top up and retry.
* **Data Privacy:** The prompts you send and the contracts generated may be sensitive. According to ChainGPT‚Äôs policies, your data is processed to generate results but you should still avoid sending highly sensitive information in prompts. Also, store any returned contract code securely if it‚Äôs not meant to be public.

By following these practices, you can ensure that your integration with ChainGPT is secure and reliable. The SDK‚Äôs design (using API keys and credit limits) helps protect the service and users; adhering to these guidelines protects your own application from misuse or unexpected costs.

# Smart-Contracts Auditor (API & SDK)

## Smart-Contracts Auditor (API & SDK) - Overview

ChainGPT‚Äôs **AI Smart Contract Auditor** is an advanced developer tool that uses AI to automatically audit smart contracts for security vulnerabilities, logical bugs, gas inefficiencies, and compliance issues. It delivers quick, in-depth analysis of Solidity-based contracts, helping developers ensure their code is secure and optimized **before deployment**. The Auditor is accessible via a RESTful **API** and a convenient **Node.js SDK**, making it easy to integrate into your development workflow or products.

***

### **Key Capabilities:**

* **AI-Powered Vulnerability Detection:** Leverages ChainGPT‚Äôs Web3-trained AI engine to identify known **security vulnerabilities** (reentrancy, overflow/underflow, access control flaws, etc.) and even complex attack vectors. The AI deeply understands contract logic and intent, enabling it to catch subtle bugs and exploits that simple linters might miss.
* **Logic & Compliance Analysis:** Comprehends the contract‚Äôs behavior to ensure it aligns with intended functionality. It checks for **business logic errors** and verifies compliance with standards (e.g. ERC-20/721/4626) and best practices. It flags issues like centralization risks or missing permission checks, and confirms implementations follow **industry standards** and **governance requirements**.
* **Optimization Insights:** Identifies **gas inefficiencies** and suboptimal code patterns. The Auditor suggests improvements to save gas and optimize performance (e.g. unnecessary computations, expensive operations that could be cheaper). This helps you refine your contract for cost-effective on-chain execution.
* **Comprehensive Audit Reports:** For each run, the AI provides a clear **audit report** including an overall security score (0‚Äì100%), categorized findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational), detailed descriptions of each issue, and recommended fixes. Results are returned within **minutes**, complete with human-readable explanations and actionable remediation steps. You can also obtain the report as a structured **JSON** (via API/SDK) for programmatic use. (Full audit reports are coming in Q2 2025).

***

### **Key Benefits:**

* **Time-Efficient Audits:** Perform thorough audits in a fraction of the time compared to traditional manual security reviews. What might take a human auditor days or weeks is delivered by ChainGPT‚Äôs AI in **just a few minutes** ‚Äì often faster than a single blockchain block time. This rapid feedback accelerates development without compromising security checks.
* **Cost Savings:** Manual smart contract audits can cost thousands of dollars. ChainGPT‚Äôs Auditor uses a simple **credit-based pricing** (1 credit per audit request) that reduces costs by up to **100√ó**. Developers and projects can iterate and re-audit frequently without breaking the budget, making security best-practices accessible even to small teams.
* **On-Chain Readiness:** The Auditor ensures your contract is **deployment-ready**. By catching critical issues pre-launch, it helps prevent costly exploits and failures in production. It supports multiple blockchains ‚Äì Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, **and more** ‚Äì so you can vet contracts across ecosystems. (There is also beta support for other environments like Solana‚Äôs Rust contracts.) This cross-chain coverage enhances security **due diligence** no matter where you deploy.
* **Seamless Integration:** Designed to slot into your development workflow, the Auditor can be used interactively or automated in pipelines. Use the API/SDK to run audits as part of your CI/CD process (for example, on each pull request or before deploying to mainnet) to continuously enforce security standards. It acts as an **additional layer of security** alongside code reviews and testing, boosting confidence in your code‚Äôs quality.

**Real-World Adoption:** ChainGPT‚Äôs Auditor is battle-tested in the field. For example, it was featured in TronDAO‚Äôs **HackaTRON** hackathon as an AI partner for smart contract tooling ‚Äì allowing developers in the competition to quickly audit their Tron/EVM-based contracts. Many developers, projects, and even ecosystem partners (across Ethereum and BNB Chain communities) are already leveraging the Auditor to improve smart contract security and reliability.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Upcoming Enhancements:** *By Q2 2025, ChainGPT plans to launch an **in-depth PDF report** feature.* This will provide a fully formatted, professional audit report (suitable for investors or compliance) comparable to those from leading security firms like CertiK. The PDF reports will include comprehensive findings and executive summaries, further solidifying the AI Auditor as a go-to solution for thorough smart contract audits.
{% endhint %}

***

### Pre-Deployment & CI/CD Integration

Integrating the ChainGPT Auditor into your **pre-deployment** checks or **CI/CD pipelines** can significantly strengthen your security posture. By automatically auditing each new smart contract (or each update) **before it‚Äôs deployed** to the blockchain, you catch vulnerabilities early when they are cheapest to fix. For example, you might add an Auditor API call in a GitHub Actions workflow or in your deployment script ‚Äì if any High or Critical issues are found, the pipeline can fail the build, preventing an unsafe contract from going live. Because the Auditor runs quickly and through code, it fits naturally into continuous integration processes. This proactive approach (preventative security) helps avoid costly exploits and builds confidence that every contract version meets a baseline of security and quality before reaching production. In short, using ChainGPT‚Äôs Auditor in CI/CD ensures security is not an afterthought but a continuous, automated part of development.

***

Common fixes include regenerating your API key (if you suspect an auth problem), ensuring your request format is correct, and confirming you have credits. The ChainGPT team is continuously improving the Auditor, so also ensure you have the latest SDK version.
* **Feedback & Updates:** Since the Auditor is an evolving product (with major updates planned, like the Q2 2025 enhancements), keep an eye on ChainGPT‚Äôs announcements for new features. You may need to update the SDK or adjust your integration to take advantage of new capabilities (such as retrieving PDF reports in the future). Providing feedback on your experience (e.g., via ChainGPT‚Äôs support channels) can also help improve the tool.

With this API and SDK, you have a high-quality, AI-driven smart contract security auditor at your fingertips. Integrate it into your development lifecycle to catch bugs early, ensure compliance, and ship robust smart contracts with confidence. Happy auditing!


# QuickStart Guide

## ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor QuickStart Guide

Welcome to the ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor QuickStart. This guide will help you set up your account and perform your first smart contract audit using ChainGPT‚Äôs Auditor, via either the REST API or the official Node.js SDK. By the end, you‚Äôll be able to send an audit request and receive results, whether through a simple HTTP call or within a Node.js application.

***

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following in place:

* **ChainGPT Account & API Key:** Sign up for an account on the ChainGPT web app and navigate to the **API Dashboard** to create a new **Secret Key** (API key). Copy this key ‚Äì you‚Äôll need it for authentication. **Ensure your account has credits** available, as each API call consumes credits (more on this below).
* **Development Environment:**
  * For using the **REST API**: a tool to make HTTP requests (e.g. cURL, Postman, or any HTTP client).
  * For using the **Node.js SDK**: a Node.js environment (Node installed on your system) and a package manager like npm or yarn.
* **Smart Contract to Audit:** This can be the Solidity source code of a smart contract or any prompt describing the audit you want. In our examples, we‚Äôll use a simple Solidity contract.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** Keep your API key **secret**. Do not hard-code it in public code or repositories. Use environment variables or a secure storage mechanism to store the key in production.
{% endhint %}

**Note:** ChainGPT uses a credit system for the Auditor. **1 credit** is deducted per audit request. If you enable the chat history feature (explained below), **an additional 1 credit** is deducted per request. Ensure you have sufficient credits to avoid interruptions.
{% endhint %}

***

### Option 1: Using the REST API

The ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor can be accessed via a RESTful HTTP endpoint. This option is ideal if you want to integrate audits into any environment or language that can make HTTP requests.

#### Endpoint and Authentication

The base endpoint for audit requests is:

```
POST https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream
```

All requests must include your API key in the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

This key authenticates you to the Auditor service. In the request **body**, you will send JSON with at least two fields:

* **`model`** ‚Äì the model name, which **must** be `"smart_contract_auditor"`.
* **`question`** ‚Äì your prompt or question for the auditor (e.g. the contract code and any specific instructions).

Optional fields:

* **`chatHistory`** ‚Äì set to `"on"` or `"off"` to enable or disable saving of chat history. (By default, history is off if not provided.)
* **`sdkUniqueId`** ‚Äì an optional unique identifier for your user or session, used for tracking conversation history per user. This is mainly useful in multi-user applications (more on this in Best Practices).

With these in mind, let's make our first audit request.

#### Auditing a Contract via cURL

One of the simplest ways to test the API is by using **cURL** from the command line. Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the API key you obtained, and run the following command:

```
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "smart_contract_auditor",
    "question": "Audit the following contract:\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\ncontract Counter {\n    uint256 private count;\n    constructor() {\n        count = 0;\n    }\n    function increment() public {\n        count += 1;\n        emit CountChanged(count);\n    }\n}\n",
    "chatHistory": "off"
  }'
```

This request sends a Solidity contract (a simple counter) to the Auditor. The response will stream back the audit results. You should see the Auditor‚Äôs analysis of the contract‚Äôs code, including any potential issues or summaries, printed to your terminal.

* The `Authorization` header carries your secret key.
* The JSON body specifies the model and the question. We included the Solidity code in the question prompt by prefixing it with "Audit the following contract:".
* We set `chatHistory` to `"off"` for this basic request, meaning the conversation won‚Äôt be stored.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** You can replace the contract in the `question` field with your own Solidity code or even ask a question about the contract. For example, you might ask the Auditor, *"What vulnerabilities are in the following contract?"* followed by the code. The Auditor will respond accordingly.
{% endhint %}

#### Streaming Results with Axios (Node.js)

The Auditor endpoint delivers results as a **stream**, meaning the response is sent back in chunks (this is similar to how OpenAI‚Äôs streaming responses work). To handle streaming responses programmatically, you can use Node.js with an HTTP client like **Axios**.

In the example below, we use Axios to call the Auditor API and print the streamed chunks as they arrive:

```
const axios = require('axios');

const API_URL = "https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream";
const API_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY>";

async function main() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      API_URL,
      {
        model: "smart_contract_auditor",
        question: `Audit the following contract:
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract Counter {
  uint256 private count; // This variable will hold the count
  constructor() {
    count = 0; // Initialize count to 0
  }
  function increment() public {
    count += 1;
    emit CountChanged(count); // Emit an event whenever the count changes
  }
}`,
        chatHistory: "on"
      },
      {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` },
        responseType: 'stream'  // ensure the response is returned as a stream
      }
    );

    // Print streamed chunks to console as they arrive
    response.data.on('data', (chunk) => {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
    });
    response.data.on('end', () => {
      console.log("\n[Audit stream ended]");
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("API request error:", error);
  }
}

main();
```

In this code:

* We post to the same `API_URL` with the required `model` and `question` fields. We‚Äôve set `chatHistory: "on"` to demonstrate enabling the history (this will store the conversation on the server for later retrieval).
* **Axios** is configured with `responseType: 'stream'`, so `response.data` will be a Node.js readable stream. We attach listeners to output each data chunk immediately and log when the stream ends.
* Be sure to replace `API_KEY` with your actual key (or use `process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY` and load your environment variables as a best practice).

When you run this script, you should see the audit result gradually printed to your console. This streaming mode is useful for potentially long analyses, allowing you to start reading results without waiting for the entire response.

#### Fetching Chat History via REST API

If you have enabled chat history for your requests, the Auditor service stores recent conversation history. You can retrieve past audits using the **Chat History** endpoint. This is helpful for reviewing past audit results or continuing an interactive session.

The chat history endpoint is:

```
GET https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/chatHistory
```

It supports query parameters to paginate or sort the history:

* `limit` ‚Äì number of records to fetch (e.g. 10).
* `offset` ‚Äì starting index for pagination (e.g. 0 to start from the latest).
* `sortBy` ‚Äì field to sort by (use `"createdAt"` for chronological sorting).
* `sortOrder` ‚Äì `"asc"` or `"desc"` for ascending/descending order.

For example, to fetch the 10 most recent audit sessions in descending order, you can use cURL:

```
curl "https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/chatHistory?limit=10&offset=0&sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=desc" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

This will return a JSON response containing your chat history. Each entry typically includes information like the question (prompt) you asked and the Auditor‚Äôs response, along with timestamps. For instance, the response data structure has a list (e.g. in a field called `rows`) of history records.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** Only requests made with `chatHistory: "on"` are recorded in history. If you call the history endpoint but had never enabled history in your audit requests, the returned list will be empty or contain no entries. Always turn on chat history for the requests you want to log.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Retrieving chat history does **not** consume additional credits. You pay the credit cost when creating an audit (with history enabled), but querying the saved history is free.
{% endhint %}

***

### Option 2: Using the Node.js SDK

ChainGPT provides an official Node.js SDK for the Smart Contract Auditor, which wraps the API and handles streaming for you. This is the recommended approach if you are building a Node.js application, as it provides a more convenient interface and built-in error handling.

#### Installation

First, install the SDK package via npm or yarn:

```
npm install --save @chaingpt/smartcontractauditor
# or
yarn add @chaingpt/smartcontractauditor
```

This will add the Smart Contract Auditor SDK to your project. (Ensure you have Node.js and npm/yarn set up beforehand.)

#### Initializing the SDK

To use the SDK, import the `SmartContractAuditor` class and initialize it with your API key:

```
import { SmartContractAuditor } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractauditor";

const smartcontractauditor = new SmartContractAuditor({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
});
```

This creates a client instance (`smartcontractauditor`) that is authorized with your API key. (As before, consider loading the API key from an environment variable in practice, instead of hardcoding it.)

#### Auditing a Contract (Stream Mode)

Using the SDK, you can request an audit and receive the result as a stream. The SDK provides an method `auditSmartContractStream()` for this. Here‚Äôs an example:

```
import { SmartContractAuditor } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractauditor";

const smartcontractauditor = new SmartContractAuditor({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
});

async function main() {
  // Request an audit stream
  const stream = await smartcontractauditor.auditSmartContractStream({
    question: `Audit the following contract:
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract Counter {
    uint256 private count; // This variable will hold the count
    constructor() {
        count = 0; // Initialize count to 0
    }
    function increment() public {
        count += 1;
        emit CountChanged(count); // Emit an event whenever the count changes
    }
}`,
    chatHistory: "on"
  });
  
  // Listen for streamed data
  stream.on('data', chunk => {
    console.log(chunk.toString());
  });
  stream.on('end', () => {
    console.log("Stream ended");
  });
}

main();
```

In this code:

* We call `auditSmartContractStream()` with a prompt containing our Solidity contract and set `chatHistory: "on"`. This returns a readable stream (`stream`).
* We attach event listeners to output each chunk of data as it arrives, and log when the stream ends. The Auditor‚Äôs response will be streamed chunk by chunk, similar to the raw Axios example earlier, but the SDK abstracts the setup for you.
* The stream delivers the Auditor‚Äôs analysis progressively. This is useful for getting immediate feedback on the audit as it runs.

#### Auditing a Contract (Blob Mode)

If you prefer to get the full response in one go (instead of streaming), the SDK offers `auditSmartContractBlob()`. This method waits for the Auditor to finish analyzing and returns the complete result (often referred to as a "blob" of data). Here‚Äôs how to use it:

```
import { SmartContractAuditor } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractauditor";

const smartcontractauditor = new SmartContractAuditor({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
});

async function main() {
  // Request an audit and get the full response
  const response = await smartcontractauditor.auditSmartContractBlob({
    question: `Audit the following contract:
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract Counter {
    uint256 private count;
    constructor() {
        count = 0;
    }
    function increment() public {
        count += 1;
        emit CountChanged(count);
    }
}`,
    chatHistory: "off"
  });
  
  // The complete audit result is now available
  console.log(response.data.bot);
}

main();
```

Key points:

* We call `auditSmartContractBlob()` with the contract code. Here we set `chatHistory: "off"` to perform a one-off audit without saving the session.
* The method returns a `response` object. You can access the Auditor‚Äôs answer from `response.data.bot`. (The exact structure: the SDK returns an object where `data.bot` contains the auditor‚Äôs response text.)
* This approach is simpler if you just want the final output and do not need to stream it live. However, note that you will only see the result after the Auditor has finished processing the contract, which might take some time for complex contracts.

#### Fetching Chat History via SDK

Similar to the REST API, the SDK can retrieve stored chat history using the `getChatHistory()` method. This allows you to fetch past audit sessions that were saved with chat history enabled:

```
import { SmartContractAuditor } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractauditor";

const smartcontractauditor = new SmartContractAuditor({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
});

async function main() {
  const history = await smartcontractauditor.getChatHistory({
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0,
    sortBy: "createdAt",
    sortOrder: "DESC"
  });
  
  console.log(history.data.rows);
}

main();
```

Here, we request the 10 most recent records (`limit: 10` starting at `offset: 0`) sorted by creation time in descending order (`sortOrder: "DESC"`). The returned object‚Äôs `data.rows` contains an array of history entries. Each entry represents a past audit (with details such as the question and answer).

You can adjust the parameters as needed:

* Use `sortOrder: "ASC"` for oldest-first ordering.
* Increase `limit` or change `offset` for pagination if you have many records.

Make sure you had `chatHistory: "on"` for the audit requests you want to appear here ‚Äì otherwise those sessions won‚Äôt have been saved.

***

### Common Tasks & Best Practices

Now that you have the basics, let‚Äôs cover some common scenarios and best practices to ensure a smooth integration:

* **Secure Your API Key:** Never commit your API key to source control or expose it in client-side code. Treat it like a password. In development, you can use a `.env` file and load it (for example, using `process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY` in Node). In production, use environment variables or a secret manager.
* **Environment Configuration:** The API endpoints are fixed as documented. You do not need to change the base URL. If needed, you can store the base URL (`https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream`) in a config or environment variable as well, but it‚Äôs generally static. Ensure your server can reach this URL (outbound internet access).
* **Credits Management:** Keep an eye on your ChainGPT credits. Each audit call deducts 1 credit, plus 1 more if chat history is enabled. If an API call isn‚Äôt working, verify that you have enough credits left in your account. You can check your credit balance on the ChainGPT web app.
* **Chat History Usage:** Enable `chatHistory: "on"` if you plan to ask follow-up questions or retrieve the Q\&A later. When this is on, the service will log the interaction. Use the `getChatHistory` endpoint/SDK method to fetch it as shown above. If you only need one-off answers and want to save credits, keep it off. Remember, fetching the history doesn‚Äôt cost credits beyond what was already spent.
* **Using `sdkUniqueId` for Multi-User Apps:** If you are integrating ChainGPT into an application with multiple end-users (for example, auditing contracts for different users from a single backend), use the `sdkUniqueId` field to separate their chat history and sessions. You can generate a unique UUID or use a user ID from your database. Include this `sdkUniqueId` in each audit request‚Äôs body along with `chatHistory: "on"`. This ensures that when you call `getChatHistory`, you can retrieve the history specific to that user. (In the SDK, simply pass `sdkUniqueId` in the options object for `auditSmartContractStream` or `auditSmartContractBlob` as needed.)
* **Handling Rate Limits:** The ChainGPT API has a rate limit of **200 requests per minute**. If you send too many audit requests too quickly, you may receive HTTP 429 errors or have requests rejected. Design your integration to stay within this limit. For example, spread out automated batch audits or implement a queue if necessary. If you legitimately need a higher rate, consider reaching out to ChainGPT support.
* **Interpreting Responses:** The Auditor‚Äôs response (especially in blob mode) will usually contain a detailed analysis. In JSON form, it may look like: `{ "data": { "bot": "...analysis text..." } }`. If you use the SDK‚Äôs blob method, you directly get this object, and as shown, `response.data.bot` holds the text output. If using the streaming method, the text will be delivered in chunks; you‚Äôll need to concatenate or process them in order. Make sure your code handles multi-part responses correctly (as demonstrated with the stream listeners).
* **Error Handling:** Be prepared to handle errors gracefully. If you provide an invalid API key or your credits are exhausted, the API will return an error (e.g., HTTP 401 for unauthorized or a message indicating insufficient credits). In the Node SDK, such situations throw a `SmartContractAuditorError` (available via the `Errors` export) if the response status is 4xx/5xx. For example, you can catch errors and inspect `error.message` for details. Always use try/catch around SDK calls that hit the API:

  ```
  import { SmartContractAuditor, Errors } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractauditor";
  // ... initialize smartcontractauditor as shown earlier ...
  try {
    const stream = await smartcontractauditor.auditSmartContractStream({ /* ... */ });
    // use stream
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Errors.SmartContractAuditorError) {
      console.error("Auditor API error:", error.message);
    } else {
      console.error("Unexpected error:", error);
    }
  }
  ```
* **Time Considerations:** Auditing complex smart contracts might take some time. The examples above set a 60-second timeout for Axios requests. If you anticipate longer processing (large contracts or multiple files), you might increase this timeout or handle partial responses via streaming so the connection isn‚Äôt cut off prematurely.
* **Keep SDK Updated:** The Smart Contract Auditor SDK may receive updates with new features or improvements. Check the npm package page or ChainGPT documentation for release notes. Using the latest version ensures you have the latest capabilities and bug fixes.

***

### Troubleshooting

Even with the best setup, you might encounter some issues. Here are some common problems and how to address them:

* **No Response / Empty Output:** If you call the API and get no answer or an empty response, first check that you included all required fields (`model` and `question`). The `model` must be exactly `"smart_contract_auditor"` ‚Äì if this is missing or typoed, the request won‚Äôt reach the Auditor model. Also ensure your `Authorization` header is present and correct.
* **Authentication Errors (401 Unauthorized):** This usually means your API key is missing or incorrect. Double-check that:
  * You included the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header with a valid key.
  * The key is active (if you suspect it might have been revoked, generate a new one in the ChainGPT dashboard).
  * You have enough credits ‚Äì if your credits are zero, the service may refuse requests. Top up credits via the web app if needed.
* **Insufficient Credits or Payment Required (402/403):** If the error message indicates lack of credits, you‚Äôll need to purchase or allocate more credits to your account on the ChainGPT web app before retrying.
* **Rate Limit Exceeded (429 Too Many Requests):** If you send more than 200 requests/minute, the API will start rejecting calls. Implement a backoff or delay and try again later. If you are loop-testing, add a small delay between iterations to stay under the limit.
* **Malformed Request (400 Bad Request):** This can happen if your JSON body is not formatted correctly. For instance, a common mistake is forgetting to stringify JSON in a cURL call or sending an integer where a string is expected. Ensure the `question` and other fields are properly quoted strings in JSON. If using an HTTP client library, pass a JSON object (as shown in our examples) and set the `Content-Type: application/json` header.
* **Stream Not Emitting Data (in Node):** If you use the streaming endpoint with a custom HTTP library and nothing happens, make sure you are handling the response as a stream. In Axios (browser environment) or other environments, streaming might not be supported the same way as in Node. The given Axios example works in Node.js. If implementing in another language, use an HTTP client that can handle server-sent events or chunked responses. For quick tests, cURL with the `-N` option (unbuffered mode) can help display streaming text.
* **SDK Exceptions:** When using the SDK, any exception of type `SmartContractAuditorError` will include a message describing the issue (for example, "Request failed with status code 401"). Logging or printing this message can help diagnose if it‚Äôs an auth issue, a missing parameter, etc. The SDK also ensures network errors (like inability to reach the API) are caught as exceptions. Ensure your `apiKey` is correct in the SDK initialization. If you see a syntax-related error, verify that your Node version supports the syntax used (the SDK is written in modern JavaScript/TypeScript).
* **Debugging Tips:** Use logging. For REST API calls, log the request payload and the response status/body for debugging. For the SDK, you can intercept or print the parameters you pass in. If an audit seems to hang, try the same input with chatHistory off (to rule out any history issues), or vice versa. You can also test the input in the ChainGPT web app‚Äôs Auditor interface (if available) to see if the issue might be with the service or your integration.

If you encounter an issue not covered above, consider reaching out via ChainGPT‚Äôs support channels or community forums. Often, checking the official documentation or GitBook for updates can also provide insights.

# API Reference

## ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor API Reference

### Introduction

The **ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor API** allows developers to integrate automated smart contract security auditing into their applications via simple HTTP requests. This API provides direct access to ChainGPT‚Äôs smart contract auditing AI, enabling you to submit Solidity code and receive an AI-generated audit report. By using HTTP endpoints (REST API), you can leverage the auditor‚Äôs capabilities **without installing any SDK** or additional tools.

**Key features:**

* **Smart Contract Analysis:** Identify vulnerabilities, bugs, and security issues in Ethereum smart contract code by sending the code to the API.
* **Easy Integration:** Use standard HTTP POST/GET requests to interact with the API from any environment (backend server, command-line, etc.).
* **Streaming Responses:** Receive audit results in real-time as they are generated, allowing for interactive or incremental display in your application.
* **Chat History (Optional):** Enable conversation memory to let the AI remember previous audit queries and results, and retrieve those past interactions via an endpoint.
* **Secure and Controlled Access:** Authentication is done with API keys, and usage is metered with credit-based billing and rate limits for fair use (details below).

**Prerequisites:** Before using the API, ensure you have the following:

* A ChainGPT account with access to the Smart Contract Auditor and an active API key (see **Authentication** below).
* Sufficient **credits** in your ChainGPT account (purchased via the ChainGPT web app) to cover API usage.
* An environment for making HTTP requests (e.g. Node.js, Python, Postman, or curl in a terminal) and internet connectivity.

***

### Authentication & API Access

All requests to the Smart Contract Auditor API must include a valid API key in the request headers. Your API key authenticates your requests and tracks your usage (for credits and rate limiting).

**Getting an API Key:**

1. Log in to the ChainGPT web app at [**app.chaingpt.org**](https://app.chaingpt.org) with your account.
2. Navigate to the **API Dashboard** or **API Keys** section.
3. Use the ‚ÄúCreate Secret Key‚Äù feature to generate a new API key.
4. Copy the API key and **store it securely**. (Once generated, you won‚Äôt be able to view the full key again for security reasons.)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** Treat your API key like a password. **Do not expose or hard-code your API key** in public client-side code or repositories. Store it in a secure location (e.g. an environment variable or a secrets manager) and load it in your app backend or secure environment.
{% endhint %}

**Using the API Key:**\
Include the API key in the Authorization header for every API request. Use the Bearer authentication scheme:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

For example, if your API key is `abc123...`, set the header as:\
`Authorization: Bearer abc123...`

All API endpoints are served over **HTTPS** (secure HTTP). Always ensure you are calling the `https://api.chaingpt.org` endpoints and include the `Authorization` header. The API expects request and response bodies in JSON format, so you should typically set `Content-Type: application/json` for POST requests.

***

### Credits & Usage Limits

ChainGPT uses a credit-based system to bill for API usage. You must have sufficient credits in your account for the Smart Contract Auditor API calls to succeed. Each API call will deduct credits as follows:

* **Audit Request:** Each call to the audit endpoint (each smart contract audit request) costs **1 Credit**.
* **Chat History Surcharge:** If chat history is enabled for an audit request (see the `chatHistory` parameter), an **additional 1 Credit** is deducted for that request (total 2 credits for that call). This covers the storage and management of the conversation history.
* **Chat History Retrieval:** Retrieving stored chat history via the history endpoint does **not** deduct additional credits, provided that those interactions were already recorded (you paid for them when `chatHistory` was "on" in the audit requests).

Credits will be automatically debited from your ChainGPT account **per request**. If your account‚Äôs credit balance is insufficient, audit requests will fail (the API will return an error indicating insufficient credits). Always ensure your account has enough credits to avoid interruptions.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Credit costs and policies may be updated over time. The above values (1 credit per audit, +1 with history) are current as of writing. Always refer to the ChainGPT web app or pricing documentation for the latest credit pricing and usage details.
{% endhint %}

**Rate Limits:** To prevent abuse, the API imposes a rate limit of **200 requests per minute** per API key. If you exceed this rate, you will receive a **429 Too Many Requests** error. Design your integration to stay within this limit (e.g., by queuing or spacing out calls if necessary). If you consistently need a higher rate limit, consider contacting ChainGPT support for options.

### Audit Request ‚Äì *Smart Contract Audit Endpoint*

This endpoint accepts a smart contract auditing request and returns the audit result. Under the hood, it submits your prompt (typically the contract code and any specific question) to ChainGPT‚Äôs AI and streams back the response (the audit analysis).

**Endpoint:** `POST https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream`\
**Description:** Submits a smart contract code or audit query to the ChainGPT auditor and returns the AI‚Äôs response as a stream of data (allowing you to read the answer progressively).

#### Request

* **Method:** `POST`
* **URL:** `https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream`
* **Headers:**
  * `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required)
  * `Content-Type: application/json` (required for the JSON body)
* **Body:** JSON object with the following parameters:

<table><thead><tr><th width="124.52734375">Parameter</th><th width="91.5859375">Type</th><th width="88.5546875">Required</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>model</strong></td><td>string</td><td><strong>Yes</strong></td><td>The ID of the AI model to use. For the Smart Contract Auditor API, this <strong>must</strong> be set to <code>"smart_contract_auditor"</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>question</strong></td><td>string</td><td><strong>Yes</strong></td><td>The user‚Äôs prompt or query. In practice, this is where you provide the smart contract code and any specific instructions or questions for the auditor. You can ask the AI to audit a piece of code by including the Solidity code in this string. <em>(There is no separate field for code; include the code as part of the question text.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>chatHistory</strong></td><td>string (<code>"on"</code> or <code>"off"</code>)</td><td>No (default <code>"off"</code>)</td><td>Whether to enable chat history (conversation memory) for this request. If <code>"on"</code>, this request and its response will be stored, and the AI will remember this conversation context in future requests. If <code>"off"</code>, the AI treats this as a single-turn query (no memory of past questions), and no history is saved. Enabling chat history incurs an extra credit cost (see <strong>Credits</strong> above).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>sdkUniqueId</strong></td><td>string</td><td>No</td><td>A unique identifier for the user or session making the request. This is used in conjunction with <code>chatHistory</code>. If you plan to have multiple separate conversations or multiple end-users using your API key, assign a distinct <code>sdkUniqueId</code> for each user or session. This ensures that when <code>chatHistory</code> is <code>"on"</code>, the stored history is tied to that specific <code>sdkUniqueId</code> and not mixed with other sessions. If omitted, all history-enabled requests under your API key will share a single, global history.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Notes on `chatHistory` and `sdkUniqueId`:** If you enable chat history, the API will remember the conversation context. To maintain separate histories for different users or threads, use a different `sdkUniqueId` for each. For example, if User A and User B both make audit requests with your API key, give them distinct IDs (`sdkUniqueId: "userA"` vs `sdkUniqueId: "userB"`). The auditor will remember past interactions **per ID**. When you make subsequent calls with `chatHistory: "on"` and the same `sdkUniqueId`, the AI will recall previous questions/answers from that session, providing continuity (useful for follow-up questions or iterative audits).

#### Response

On success, this endpoint responds with an **HTTP 200** status and begins streaming the audit result through the HTTP response body. The response is streamed in chunks (using chunked transfer encoding), allowing the client to start receiving and processing the output before the entire audit report is complete. This is ideal for displaying results in real-time to users.

* **Streaming Format:** Each chunk of data is a portion of the auditor‚Äôs answer (usually a piece of text). The chunks, when concatenated in order, form the full audit report. The API does not wrap each chunk in JSON; it streams the raw text of the answer. You should keep the connection open and read continuously until the stream ends (the end of the response signals the completion of the audit report).
* **Final Output:** If you capture or recombine the entire streamed response, the full message typically can be represented as a JSON object with a structure like:

  ```
  {
    "status": true,
    "message": "Chat response generated successfully.",
    "data": {
      "bot": "<complete audit report text>"
    }
  }
  ```

  In streaming mode, this JSON is effectively sent as a continuous text stream (without needing a closing `]` or `}` until the end). The main content of interest is the **`data.bot`** field, which contains the auditor‚Äôs answer (the audit findings and explanations). The `status` and `message` provide a high-level confirmation. You may parse the final aggregated text as JSON if needed, or simply use the raw text of the `bot` response.
* **Error Handling:** If your request is unauthorized (e.g., missing or invalid API key), the API will immediately return an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error. If you exceed rate limits, a 429 error will be returned. Insufficient credits or other invalid request issues will result in an error response (often with an error message in JSON). In streaming mode, an error usually causes the connection to close early, possibly with an error JSON before closing. Always implement error handling: check HTTP status codes and be prepared to handle a terminated stream or error object.

#### Example: Audit Request (Streaming)

Below is an example of how to call the audit endpoint using **Node.js (JavaScript)** with the Axios HTTP client, and how to handle the streaming response. In this example, we ask the AI to audit a simple Solidity contract:

```
import axios from 'axios';

// Set up the API endpoint and API key (loaded from environment for security)
const API_URL = 'https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream';
const API_KEY = process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY;  // ensure you've stored your key in an env variable

// Create an Axios instance with the authorization header and stream response enabled
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_URL,
  timeout: 60000,  // 60 seconds timeout
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` },
  responseType: 'stream'   // important for streaming responses
});

async function auditContract() {
  try {
    // Make the POST request to the audit endpoint
    const response = await apiClient.post('/', {
      model: "smart_contract_auditor",
      question: `Audit the following smart contract:
      \`\`\`
      pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
      contract Counter {
          uint256 private count;
          event CountChanged(uint256 newCount);
          constructor() {
              count = 0;
          }
          function increment() public {
              count += 1;
              emit CountChanged(count);
          }
      }
      \`\`\`
      Identify any security issues or improvements.`,
      chatHistory: "on",
      sdkUniqueId: "user12345"  // an example unique ID for this session/user
    });
    
    // `response.data` is a Readable stream since we set responseType: 'stream'
    const stream = response.data;
    stream.on('data', (chunk) => {
      // Process each chunk of the response as it arrives
      const textChunk = chunk.toString();
      process.stdout.write(textChunk);  // here we simply print it out (could accumulate if needed)
    });
    stream.on('end', () => {
      console.log("\n[Audit complete]");
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during audit request:", error.response?.data || error.message);
  }
}

auditContract();
```

In the above example, the contract code is embedded in the `question` string (using a template literal for readability). The response stream is consumed chunk by chunk, and written to standard output. In a real application, you might accumulate the chunks and display them in a UI as they arrive. The `chatHistory: "on"` parameter means this Q/A will be stored, and since we provided `sdkUniqueId: "user12345"`, the context is scoped to that ID for future calls.

**Example (cURL):** Alternatively, you can test the endpoint with a curl command. This will print the response to your terminal as it streams:

```
curl -X POST "https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "smart_contract_auditor",
    "question": "Please audit the following Solidity code...\n<YOUR CONTRACT CODE HERE>",
    "chatHistory": "off"
  }'
```

*(Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and the `question` content with your actual API key and contract/prompt. The `chatHistory` is set to "off" in this curl example for simplicity.)*

***

### Chat History ‚Äì *Retrieve Past Interactions*

If you have enabled `chatHistory` for your audit requests, the API stores those conversations (prompts and responses). The **Chat History endpoint** allows you to retrieve a log of past audit queries and their results associated with your API key (and optionally filtered by a specific `sdkUniqueId` session).

**Endpoint:** `GET https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/chatHistory`\
**Description:** Fetches stored chat history (audit Q\&A records) for your account. You can use query parameters to paginate results, sort them, or filter by a specific session ID.

#### Request

* **Method:** `GET`
* **URL:** `https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/chatHistory`
* **Headers:**
  * `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (required)
* **Query Parameters:** (passed as URL query string or using your HTTP client‚Äôs query params support)

<table><thead><tr><th width="121.16015625">Parameter</th><th width="89.65234375">Type</th><th width="87.8203125">Required</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>limit</strong></td><td>integer</td><td>No</td><td>The number of history records to retrieve in this request (page size). If not provided, a default (e.g. 10) is used. Example: <code>limit=10</code> will return up to 10 audit entries.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>offset</strong></td><td>integer</td><td>No</td><td>The number of records to skip (for pagination). For example, <code>offset=0</code> starts from the first record (usually the most recent if using default sort), <code>offset=10</code> would skip the first 10 records. Default is 0.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>sortBy</strong></td><td>string</td><td>No</td><td>Field to sort by. Default is <code>"createdAt"</code> (the timestamp of the interaction). Currently, <code>"createdAt"</code> is the primary field available for sorting.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>sortOrder</strong></td><td>string</td><td>No</td><td>Sort direction: <code>"desc"</code> for descending (newest first) or <code>"asc"</code> for ascending (oldest first). Default is <code>"desc"</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>sdkUniqueId</strong></td><td>string</td><td>No</td><td>If provided, only return history entries that were associated with this <code>sdkUniqueId</code>. Use this to fetch the conversation history for a specific user or session (if you have multiple under one API key). If omitted, the response will include all stored interactions for your API key (across all sessions).</td></tr></tbody></table>

You can combine these parameters as needed. For example, you might call `GET /chat/chatHistory?limit=5&offset=0&sortOrder=asc&sdkUniqueId=user12345` to get the oldest 5 records for session ‚Äúuser12345‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt need filtering or pagination, you can just call `/chat/chatHistory` with no params (defaults will apply).

#### Response

On success, the server will return **HTTP 200** and a JSON object containing the history records. The response structure is:

```
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Chat history retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "rows": [
      {
        "id": "<record-id-1>",
        "question": "<the audit question from your request>",
        "bot": "<the auditor's response>",
        "createdAt": "2025-04-13T21:48:00.123Z",
        "sdkUniqueId": "<session-id-if-used>"
      },
      {
        "id": "<record-id-2>",
        "question": "<next audit question>",
        "bot": "<auditor's answer>",
        "createdAt": "2025-04-13T21:49:30.456Z",
        "sdkUniqueId": "<session-id-if-used>"
      }
      // ... more records up to the specified limit
    ],
    "count": 2
  }
}
```

* **`data.rows`**: an array of history entries. Each entry represents one audit Q\&A interaction. Fields include:
  * `id`: an internal identifier for the record.
  * `question`: the exact question/prompt that was sent (e.g. the contract code and query).
  * `bot`: the auditor‚Äôs full response to that question.
  * `createdAt`: timestamp when the interaction occurred (ISO 8601 format).
  * `sdkUniqueId`: the session identifier if one was associated with this interaction (absent or null if none was provided).
* **`data.count`**: the number of records returned in this response (e.g. for pagination tracking).
* **`status` / `message`**: indicate the success of the request and a human-readable message.

Using this data, you can display a history of audits to your users or utilize past answers. For example, you might show users a list of their previous contract audits or allow them to review an audit report again.

**Note:** Retrieving chat history does **not** consume credits. You are effectively accessing records you‚Äôve already paid for when the history was created. However, you must have had `chatHistory: "on"` in the original requests for any records to exist (if history was off, that interaction is not stored).

#### Example: Retrieve Chat History

Here‚Äôs an example using Axios (Node.js) to fetch the 10 most recent audit interactions:

```
import axios from 'axios';

const HISTORY_URL = 'https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/chatHistory';
const API_KEY = process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY;

async function fetchHistory() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(HISTORY_URL, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` },
      params: {
        limit: 10,
        offset: 0,
        sortBy: "createdAt",
        sortOrder: "desc"
        // sdkUniqueId: "user12345"  // optionally filter by a specific session
      }
    });
    // The history records are in response.data.data.rows
    console.log("Retrieved records:", response.data.data.rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching history:", error.response?.data || error.message);
  }
}

fetchHistory();
```

This will output an array of up to 10 recent audit sessions (including the questions and answers). You can adjust the parameters as needed or add `sdkUniqueId` to filter for a specific user‚Äôs history.

**Example (cURL):** Fetch 5 most recent history records using curl:

```
curl -G "https://api.chaingpt.org/chat/chatHistory" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode "limit=5" \
  --data-urlencode "offset=0" \
  --data-urlencode "sortOrder=desc"
```

(Add `--data-urlencode "sdkUniqueId=yourUserId"` if you want to filter by a session ID.)

***

### Security Considerations

Integrating the ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor API requires attention to security and best practices:

* **API Key Security:** Keep your API key secret at all times. Do not embed it in client-side code or anywhere it could be exposed publicly. If you suspect your API key is compromised, revoke it in the ChainGPT dashboard and generate a new one. Only send the API key over HTTPS (which the `api.chaingpt.org` endpoints use by default).
* **Authentication Required:** All endpoints demand a valid API key. Without authentication, or with an incorrect key, requests will be rejected (HTTP 401). There is no "public" or unauthorized access mode.
* **Credits and Authorization:** The API will only process requests if your account has sufficient credits. This acts as a security measure to prevent abuse and ensure only authorized (paying) users can use the resource-intensive audit service. Always monitor your credit balance, especially in production environments, to avoid disruptions.
* **Rate Limiting:** As noted, the API enforces a limit of 200 requests per minute per API key. This protects the service from abuse and ensures fair usage. If you hit this limit, back off and retry after a short delay. Do not try to work around the rate limit (e.g., by creating multiple keys for the same app) as this may violate the terms of service and result in suspension.
* **Data Privacy:** The code you send and the audit results are processed by ChainGPT‚Äôs AI. ChainGPT does not share your code or responses with unauthorized parties, and your data is used only to provide the service. However, avoid sending any sensitive personal data in the prompts. The focus should be on code analysis. (For more details on data handling, refer to ChainGPT‚Äôs privacy policy.)
* **Network Security:** Always use HTTPS to interact with the API. The endpoints provided (`api.chaingpt.org`) are TLS/SSL encrypted. This ensures your API key and data are not exposed in transit.

By following these practices, you help maintain the security of your application and safeguard your access to the ChainGPT API.

# SDK Reference

## ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor SDK Reference

### Introduction

#### Purpose and Scope

The **ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor SDK** is a software development kit that allows developers to integrate ChainGPT's smart contract auditing capabilities directly into their own applications, platforms, or services. It provides a convenient library for programmatically sending smart contracts for audit and receiving AI-generated audit reports. This reference documentation covers the SDK's features, usage, and integration guidelines in detail, enabling you to quickly adopt the SDK in your development workflow.

#### Intended Audience

This documentation is intended for developers, software engineers, and system integrators who plan to use or are already using the Smart Contract Auditor SDK. It assumes a working knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and Node.js. Readers should be comfortable with installing npm packages and handling asynchronous operations (Promises/`async`/`await`) in Node.js.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the Smart Contract Auditor SDK, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* **Node.js environment:** A supported operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) with Node.js installed (JavaScript/TypeScript runtime).
* **Development tools:** A project or IDE setup for Node.js development (e.g., npm or Yarn for package management).
* **ChainGPT API access:** An active ChainGPT account with access to the Smart Contract Auditor service.
* **API Key:** A ChainGPT API key associated with your account (obtained from the ChainGPT web application).
* **Credits on ChainGPT:** Sufficient credits in your ChainGPT account (via the ChainGPT web app at [app.chaingpt.org](https://app.chaingpt.org/)). The SDK consumes credits for each audit request (details on credit usage are explained below).

Having these in place will ensure a smooth integration with the SDK.

***

### Getting Started

#### Installation

To install the ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor SDK in your Node.js project, use either npm or Yarn:

```bash
npm install --save @chaingpt/smartcontractauditor

# or for yarn use:
yarn add @chaingpt/smartcontractauditor
```

This will add the SDK package to your project dependencies. The library includes TypeScript type declarations, so it can be used in TypeScript or JavaScript projects seamlessly.

#### Configuration

Before making any audit requests, you need to configure authentication and ensure your ChainGPT account has credits:

* **Credits System:** The Smart Contract Auditor SDK operates on a credit-based system. Each audit request will deduct credits from your ChainGPT account. Make sure you have purchased or earned adequate credits on the ChainGPT web application. *(Each audit call consumes 1 credit; enabling additional features like chat history will consume an extra credit per call, as described later.)*
* **Obtain API Key:** The SDK uses API keys for authenticating requests. Generate a secret API key from the ChainGPT web dashboard and use it in your application. To get an API key:
  1. Log in to the ChainGPT web application and navigate to the **API Dashboard**.
  2. Use the **Create Secret Key** feature to generate a new API key.
  3. Copy the generated API key (it will be shown only once).\
     \&#xNAN;*Note:* Treat this key like a password; **do not share or expose it publicly**.
* **Secure Storage of API Key:** For security, **avoid hard-coding the API key** in your source code or committing it to a repository. Instead, store it in a secure location such as an environment variable or a secrets management service. For example, you might set an environment variable `CGPT_API_KEY` and retrieve it in your Node.js application, so the key isn't directly visible in code.

With credits available and an API key in hand, you can proceed to initialize the SDK in your project.

#### API Key Setup and Initialization

To use the SDK, import the `SmartContractAuditor` class from the package and initialize it with your API key. This will create an SDK client instance that you will use to call audit methods. For example:

```typescript
import { SmartContractAuditor } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractauditor";

// Initialize the SDK client with your ChainGPT API key
const smartcontractauditor = new SmartContractAuditor({
  apiKey: process.env.CGPT_API_KEY || 'YOUR-CHAINGPT-API-KEY',
});
```

Once initialized, you can call the SDK methods to audit smart contracts. Here's a quick example of auditing a simple Solidity contract using the SDK, with the result streamed back:

```typescript
async function main() {
  const stream = await smartcontractauditor.auditSmartContractStream({
    question: `Audit the following contract:
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    contract Counter {
      uint256 private count;
      constructor() {
        count = 0;
      }
      function increment() public {
        count += 1;
        emit CountChanged(count);
      }
    }`,
    chatHistory: "on"  // enable chat history to preserve context (optional)
  });

  // Handle streaming response
  stream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk.toString());  // output audit result chunk
  });
  stream.on('end', () => {
    console.log("Audit stream ended.");
  });
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

In this example, we ask the auditor to **audit a simple Counter contract**. We set `chatHistory: "on"` to save this query in the conversation history (more on this in the **Chat History** section). The SDK returns a readable stream, which we listen to for `data` events to get incremental chunks of the audit report, and an `end` event when the streaming is complete.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The above code uses `auditSmartContractStream` for demonstration. The SDK also provides methods to get the full response without streaming. We will cover both usage patterns in the SDK Components section.
{% endhint %}

***

### SDK Components

The ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor SDK provides a set of methods and features for auditing smart contracts and managing the audit sessions. All functionality is accessed via the `SmartContractAuditor` instance that you created with your API key. This section details the core methods, advanced features, chat history management, and error handling in the SDK.

#### Core Methods

The core functionality of the SDK revolves around sending a smart contract (or any prompt) to ChainGPT's auditor and receiving an audit report. The primary methods to accomplish this are:

**`auditSmartContractBlob(options)`**

Audits a smart contract and returns the **full result** as a single response object (a "blob" of data). Use this method when you want to get the complete audit report in one go (for example, if you plan to display or process the entire report after the analysis is finished).

* **Parameters:** This method accepts an options object with the following properties:
  * `question` (string): The prompt for the auditor. Typically, this should include the smart contract code and any specific questions or instructions. For example, you can provide a prompt like: *"Audit the following contract: \[contract code]"*. The contract code can be included directly in the string (as shown in examples above).
  * `chatHistory` (string, optional): Set to `"on"` to enable chat history for this request, or `"off"` to treat it as a standalone query. If `"on"`, the conversation context will be preserved (and can be retrieved later), allowing for follow-up questions referencing this audit. The default is `"off"` if not provided.
  * `sdkUniqueId` (string, optional): A unique identifier for the end-user or session. This is used to segregate chat history per user in your application. If you have multiple users or sessions using the same API key, you can supply a unique UUID or identifier here to keep their audit conversations separate. (See **Chat History** below for more details.)
* **Return Value:** This method returns a **Promise** that resolves to a response object containing the audit result. On success, you can expect the response to include the auditor's findings. For example, the resolved object may have a structure like: `{ data: { bot: "‚Ä¶audit report text‚Ä¶" } }`. You can then extract the audit text (e.g., `response.data.bot`) and use it in your application.
* **Usage Example:** Auditing a contract and logging the full report:

  ```typescript
  const response = await smartcontractauditor.auditSmartContractBlob({
    question: `Audit the following contract:
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    contract Counter { 
      /* contract code */ 
    }`,
    chatHistory: "off"  // no chat context needed for a one-off query
  });
  console.log("Audit Report:", response.data.bot);
  ```

  In this example, `auditSmartContractBlob` is called with a Solidity contract in the question. We set `chatHistory: "off"` since we only want an isolated analysis. The result is then printed from `response.data.bot`. (In a real application, you might format or display this result in a UI.)

**`auditSmartContractStream(options)`**

Audits a smart contract and returns a **streaming response**, allowing you to receive the audit report progressively as it is generated. This method is useful for providing real-time feedback (for example, streaming the audit output to a console or UI as it comes in) or for handling very large responses without waiting for the entire result.

* **Parameters:** It accepts the same options as `auditSmartContractBlob`:
  * `question` (string): The audit prompt including contract code.
  * `chatHistory` (string, optional): `"on"` or `"off"` (default). When enabled, the request and its response will be logged in the chat history for retrieval or context.
  * `sdkUniqueId` (string, optional): Unique session/user identifier for segregating history (if needed).
* **Return Value:** This method returns a **Node.js Readable Stream**. You should attach event listeners to handle the stream:
  * Listen for `'data'` events to receive chunks of the audit output. Each chunk is typically a `Buffer` or string segment of the report. You may need to convert it to string (as in the examples) to handle text.
  * Listen for the `'end'` event to know when the audit report is fully received (the stream has finished).
  * Optionally, listen for `'error'` events to catch any errors emitted during streaming.
* **Usage Example:** Auditing a contract with streaming output:

  ```typescript
  const stream = await smartcontractauditor.auditSmartContractStream({
    question: `Audit the following contract:
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    contract Counter { 
      /* contract code */ 
    }`,
    chatHistory: "on"
  });
  stream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.toString());  // stream chunks to stdout or handle them as needed
  });
  stream.on('end', () => {
    console.log("\n[Audit complete]");
  });
  ```

  Here, we enabled `chatHistory: "on"` to save the interaction. As the ChainGPT auditor generates the report, data chunks are streamed and immediately written to standard output. When the stream ends, we log a completion message. This allows the user to start seeing audit results without waiting for the entire analysis to finish.

**Credit Usage:** Each call to `auditSmartContractBlob` or `auditSmartContractStream` will deduct **1 credit** from your ChainGPT account for the audit operation. If you enable chat history (`chatHistory: "on"`), the call will consume **1 additional credit** (so 2 credits total for that request) to cover the cost of storing and managing the conversation context. Please ensure your account has enough credits before making requests. If a request is made without sufficient credits or with an invalid API key, it will fail with an error.

#### Advanced Features

Beyond the basic request/response workflow, the Smart Contract Auditor SDK offers several advanced features to enhance integration:

* **Streamed Responses:** The SDK supports real-time streaming of responses (via `auditSmartContractStream`). This is useful for providing immediate feedback to users or handling large responses efficiently. You can process chunks of the audit output as they arrive, improving the responsiveness of your application.
* **Full Response (Blob) Mode:** If streaming is not needed, you can use the blob mode (`auditSmartContractBlob`) to get the complete response after processing. This mode is straightforward and behaves like a typical API call, encapsulating the entire result in one response object.
* **Chat History Toggle:** The SDK allows you to turn on conversation memory for audit requests. By setting `chatHistory: "on"`, each query and its response are recorded. This enables context to be maintained between subsequent calls (you can ask follow-up questions referencing previous answers) and allows you to retrieve past audits. If you don't need this, keep `chatHistory: "off"` to treat each request independently.
* **User-Specific Sessions:** For applications with multiple end-users, you can isolate each user's audit history. Using the `sdkUniqueId` parameter (a unique user or session ID) with your requests ensures that each user's chat history is kept separate on ChainGPT's side. This prevents cross-contamination of context between different users and lets you retrieve or manage each user's history individually.
* **Credit and Rate Limits:** The SDK is integrated with ChainGPT's credit system and usage policies. As noted, every audit request costs credits (1 or 2 depending on history usage). Additionally, to ensure fair usage and system stability, there is a rate limit of **200 requests per minute** per API key. If you exceed this rate, subsequent requests may be rejected or throttled. Design your application to spread out requests or queue them if you anticipate a high volume of audits.

By leveraging these features appropriately, you can build robust and user-friendly tools on top of the ChainGPT auditor. For example, you might use streaming to show live progress in a UI, enable chat history for an interactive auditing session with follow-up queries, and assign unique IDs for each project or user being audited.

#### Chat History

One of the powerful features of the Smart Contract Auditor SDK is the ability to maintain and retrieve a history of audit conversations. When chat history is enabled, the SDK will store the interactions, allowing for context continuity and later review. This section explains how to use the chat history feature.

**Enabling Chat History:** To use chat history, simply set `chatHistory: "on"` in your audit request (either stream or blob). When enabled:

* The current question and the auditor's answer will be logged on ChainGPT's servers.
* Future audit requests with `chatHistory: "on"` (using the same API key and not specifying a new unique ID) may include previous context, allowing the auditor to reference earlier discussions or findings.
* If you disable history (`chatHistory: "off"`), each request is handled in isolation with no memory of prior interactions.

**User-Specific History with `sdkUniqueId`:** If your application serves multiple users or if you want to separate history by session or project, use the `sdkUniqueId` field:

* Provide a unique identifier (for example, a UUID or user ID string) with each audit request for a given user/session. This tells ChainGPT to store the history under that ID.
* When a different `sdkUniqueId` is used, a separate history thread is maintained. This ensures user A's audits and chat context are distinct from user B's.
* If no `sdkUniqueId` is provided, the history is associated with your API key globally (meaning all your requests could be in one conversation thread). It's recommended to use an ID if you have more than one context to manage.

For example, to audit a contract with chat history enabled for a specific user session:

```typescript
const userId = "907208eb-0929-42c3-a372-c21934fbf44f"; // unique ID for a user or session
const response = await smartcontractauditor.auditSmartContractBlob({
  question: "Audit the following contract:\npragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract Counter { ... }",
  chatHistory: "on",
  sdkUniqueId: userId
});
// This call's context is now tied to the provided userId
```

In the above snippet, the audit is performed with `chatHistory` on, and the conversation is tagged with a specific `userId`. If you later make another call with the same `userId` and `chatHistory: "on"`, the auditor will have the context of the previous contract audit for that user.

**Retrieving Chat History:** The SDK provides a method `getChatHistory` to fetch the stored conversation history. This can be useful to display past audits to the user or to review previous questions and answers.

**`getChatHistory(options)`**

Fetches the audit/chat history that has been recorded for your API key (and for a specific `sdkUniqueId` if you used one in your requests).

* **Parameters:** An object with the following fields to filter and paginate the history:

  * `limit` (number, optional): The maximum number of history records to retrieve. Example: `10` to get the 10 most recent entries.
  * `offset` (number, optional): The offset (starting index) for records retrieval, useful for pagination. For example, `0` to start from the most recent record, `10` to skip the first 10 records.
  * `sortBy` (string, optional): The field by which to sort the history entries. Currently, `"createdAt"` (the timestamp of the record) is used.
  * `sortOrder` (string, optional): Sort direction, either `"ASC"` for ascending or `"DESC"` for descending order. Typically, you'd use `"DESC"` to get the latest records first.

  *Note:* If you have used `sdkUniqueId` in your audit requests to separate histories, the returned history will correspond to the context of the API key and unique ID that the SDK instance is aware of. Ensure that if you're managing multiple user histories, you call `getChatHistory` accordingly (for example, by using separate `SmartContractAuditor` instances or configuring the `sdkUniqueId` consistently before retrieval).
* **Return Value:** A Promise that resolves to an object containing the history entries. The structure is typically `{ data: { rows: [ ... ] } }`, where each item in `rows` represents a past question/answer or audit record. You can inspect these records to see the content of questions asked and answers given.
* **Usage Example:** Retrieving the last 10 audit history entries:

  ```typescript
  const history = await smartcontractauditor.getChatHistory({
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0,
    sortBy: "createdAt",
    sortOrder: "DESC"
  });
  console.log("Recent Audit History:", history.data.rows);
  ```

  This will output an array of up to 10 history records, sorted by creation time in descending order (newest first). Each entry in `history.data.rows` may include details such as the question prompt, the audit result, and timestamps. You can use this data to display a history log in your application.

**Credit Consideration for History:** Retrieving chat history via `getChatHistory` **does not consume additional credits** beyond what was already spent when initially enabling and storing that history. In other words, you pay the extra credit cost once when you call an audit with `chatHistory: "on"`, but fetching the saved history is free of charge. (If chat history was not enabled for any requests, there will be no records to retrieve.)

#### Error Handling

When using the SDK, you should be prepared to handle errors, such as network issues or invalid requests. The Smart Contract Auditor SDK will throw a specialized error class for API-related issues.

If the SDK fails to connect to the ChainGPT service, or if the API returns an error status (e.g., a 4xx client error or 5xx server error), it will throw an error of type `SmartContractAuditorError`. You can import this error class via the `Errors` object from the SDK and use it to differentiate SDK errors from other exceptions.

Here is how you might implement error handling for an audit request:

```typescript
import { SmartContractAuditor, Errors } from "@chaingpt/smartcontractauditor";

const smartcontractauditor = new SmartContractAuditor({ apiKey: 'YOUR-API-KEY' });

async function runAudit() {
  try {
    const stream = await smartcontractauditor.auditSmartContractStream({
      question: "Audit the following contract:\npragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract Counter { ... }",
      chatHistory: "on"
    });
    // If successful, use the stream as usual:
    stream.on('data', (chunk) => { /* handle data */ });
    stream.on('end', () => { /* handle completion */ });
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Errors.SmartContractAuditorError) {
      // An error occurred with the audit request
      console.error("Audit SDK Error:", error.message);
    } else {
      // Some other error (programmer error, etc.)
      console.error("Unexpected Error:", error);
    }
  }
}

runAudit();
```

In the example above, we wrap the audit call in a `try...catch` block. If an error is thrown, we check if it is an instance of `Errors.SmartContractAuditorError`. This indicates a failure related to the API request (for example, invalid API key, rate limit exceeded, insufficient credits, network timeout, etc.). We then handle it appropriately (logging the error message or alerting the user). Other types of errors (for instance, a coding bug in your application) can be handled in the `else` branch.

Always implement proper error handling around SDK calls to ensure your application can gracefully handle scenarios such as lack of credits, lost connectivity, or unexpected responses.

***

### Security Considerations

When integrating the ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor SDK, it‚Äôs important to follow best practices to keep your application and data secure:

* **API Key Security:** Your ChainGPT API key is the credential that grants access to the auditor service. **Never expose this key in client-side code or public repositories.** Treat it like a password. As mentioned, load it from a secure source (environment variable or secret manager) rather than hard-coding. Rotate the key if you suspect it has been compromised.
* **Authentication Required:** The SDK will only function with a valid API key that has sufficient credits. Unauthorized requests will fail. This ensures that only authenticated and credited users can access the audit service.
* **Credit Management:** Monitor your ChainGPT credit balance and usage. If your application might make many audit requests, implement checks or alerts for low credit status to avoid service interruptions. Remember that enabling chat history doubles the credit cost per request, so use it only when needed.
* **Rate Limiting:** As a safeguard against abuse or accidental overuse, the ChainGPT API enforces a rate limit of **200 requests per minute** per API key. Design your integration to respect this limit. If you anticipate bursts of requests (for example, a batch of contracts to audit), consider adding delays or spreading the requests over time. Hitting the rate limit will result in errors (likely `SmartContractAuditorError` with a message about too many requests).
* **Data Privacy:** The smart contracts and prompts you send to ChainGPT are processed by an AI model on ChainGPT's servers. While this is necessary for the service to function, be mindful of **sensitive information**. Avoid sending any private keys, passwords, or truly sensitive data in your audit prompts. Only send the code and information needed for the audit. Check ChainGPT‚Äôs privacy and data handling policies if this is a concern for your use case.

By following these security considerations, you can safely integrate the SDK into your application while protecting your credentials and respecting usage limits.

***

### Compatibility

The Smart Contract Auditor SDK is designed for **Node.js** environments and is distributed via npm. It supports both JavaScript and TypeScript:

* **Language:** You can use the SDK in JavaScript or TypeScript. The package is written in TypeScript and provides built-in type declarations, which means you get type hints and compile-time checks if you use TypeScript.
* **Runtime:** The SDK should run on any recent Node.js version that supports ES modules or CommonJS (the package can be imported using modern `import` syntax as shown, or via `require` in CommonJS if needed). Ensure Node is installed on your system.
* **Platform:** It is OS-agnostic ‚Äì you can use it on Windows, Linux, or macOS. Essentially, any platform that can run Node.js can utilize the SDK.
* **Environment:** The SDK is intended for server-side or backend use (Node.js). Using it directly in a browser is not officially supported, as it requires a secure API key and interacts with a backend service. If you need to call it from a frontend context, you should route the requests through a backend server to keep the API key hidden.

There are no known framework-specific requirements; you can integrate it into any Node.js application, whether it's a plain Node script, an Express backend, a Next.js API route, etc.

***

### Release Information

This SDK is under active development, and version updates will be published as new features or improvements are added. Key release information:

* **Current Version:** ‚Äì This is the initial release of the ChainGPT Smart Contract Auditor SDK. It includes core auditing functionality, streaming support, chat history management, and error handling features as described above.
* **Release History:** As this is the first release, no previous versions are available. Going forward, version changes and release notes will be documented (e.g., in a changelog on the repository or npm package page).
* **Future Updates:** Planned enhancements may include expanded methods, improved performance, and additional auditing features. Always refer to the official documentation or the npm package page for information on the latest version and its changelog before upgrading.

To ensure compatibility, pin your dependency to a specific major version or use semantic version ranges as appropriate, and test your application after upgrading the SDK.

# AI Crypto News (API & SDK & RSS)

## AI Crypto News (API & SDK & RSS) Overview

ChainGPT‚Äôs **AI Crypto News** solution is an AI-powered service that automatically gathers and generates up-to-date crypto news. It leverages advanced AI agents to **source, filter, deduplicate, and summarize** news from many outlets in real time. This ensures that developers and users get a feed of relevant crypto, blockchain, and Web3 news that is **unbiased, timely, and cross-verified** across multiple sources.

***

### How It Works

The AI news agent continuously scans trusted crypto news sites (e.g. CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, Decrypt) and even social platforms like Twitter for breaking updates. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), it **reads each article**, identifies the key facts that appear consistently across sources, and filters out any duplicates or low-value content. It then **summarizes the important points** in a concise article, **highlighting insights and removing fluff**. All of this happens autonomously, following a strict algorithm without introducing human bias. A built-in self-check mechanism cross-verifies facts so the delivered news is highly accurate.

#### **Key Features and Uniqueness:**

* **Real-Time Updates:** The system pulls the latest headlines as they happen, keeping you ahead of market movements. The AI agent runs continuously (e.g. every few minutes) to ensure new information is promptly captured and published.
* **Multi-Source Verification:** Each news piece is generated by aggregating multiple reputable sources and social signals. By cross-referencing sources, the agent delivers *consistent truths* and avoids single-source errors.
* **Unbiased Summaries:** Unlike human-curated news which may carry opinions, ChainGPT‚Äôs AI news is purely fact-focused. The AI minimizes any editorial bias, presenting a balanced perspective with just the factual highlights.
* **Deduplication:** Redundant stories are eliminated. If the same news appears on different sites, the agent recognizes it and produces one consolidated update rather than spamming developers with repeats.
* **Concise & Relevant:** Long articles are condensed to the essentials. The AI uses both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques to produce a clear, short summary of each story, so developers and users can grasp the gist quickly.

***

### Accessing the News ‚Äì RSS Feeds and SDK/API

Developers can consume ChainGPT‚Äôs AI-generated crypto news in two ways: **open RSS feeds** or the **AI News SDK/API**.

* **SDK / API:** For more control and advanced queries, developers can use the official ChainGPT AI News SDK (or directly call the API). The SDK allows fetching news with custom filters ‚Äì for example, by specific category, blockchain, or token, by keywords, and within certain date ranges. This programmable approach is ideal for integrating news into applications where you might want to dynamically query and display content.

[sdk-reference](/chaingpt-v1-docs/dev-docs-b2b-saas-api-and-sdk/ai-crypto-news-api-and-sdk-and-rss/sdk-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Open RSS Feeds:** For a plug-and-play solution, ChainGPT provides public RSS endpoints that anyone can subscribe to. These RSS feeds output the latest AI-curated news in standard XML format, which can be used in web apps, feed readers, or any RSS consumption tool. No API key or authentication is required to use the public feeds.

{% content-ref url="ai-crypto-news-api-and-sdk-and-rss/rss-reference" %}

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Both methods give access to the **same underlying AI-generated news**; the difference lies in flexibility. RSS feeds are immediate and simple to integrate (just add the URL and parse XML), while the SDK/API offers a rich set of parameters to tailor the news results to your needs.
{% endhint %}

***

### Use Cases

This AI Crypto News service can power a wide range of applications in the crypto ecosystem:

* **Crypto Dashboards & Websites:** Enrich trading platforms, portfolio trackers, or wallet dashboards with a live news feed of relevant headlines (e.g. latest DeFi news for a DeFi dashboard, token-specific news on a wallet app).
* **Telegram/Discord Bots:** Community chatbots can use the SDK to post real-time news updates in Telegram groups or Discord channels, keeping communities informed. (For example, a Telegram bot could post any new Bitcoin news to a crypto trading chat as it comes out.)
* **Media and News Outlets:** Crypto news sites or newsletters can automate content curation. The AI agent can generate daily news roundups or breaking news sections without human reporters, ensuring comprehensive coverage 24/7.
* **Trading Tools:** Traders can receive real-time alerts or see sentiment-impacting news on their trading interfaces. For instance, an exchange might use the news feed to alert users of major market-moving announcements (SEC filings, hack incidents, etc.) as soon as they hit the wires.
* **Wallets and Portfolio Apps:** Wallet applications can integrate token-specific news (via filters) to inform users about developments related to assets they hold. E.g. if a user holds Ethereum, the app can show the latest Ethereum-related headlines.
* **Community Platforms:** Any Web3 community hub can embed the news feed to keep users engaged with up-to-date information. A great example is **Binance Square**, which integrated ChainGPT‚Äôs AI news to deliver a constant flow of unbiased crypto news to its millions of users. On Binance Square, users can even filter the feed by category or token to personalize their news experience.

*Real-world implementation:* **Binance Square** has successfully deployed ChainGPT‚Äôs AI News Generator, publishing over 25,000 AI-generated news articles to date. Users on that platform get reliable, on-demand crypto updates across 20+ categories, powered entirely by ChainGPT‚Äôs AI agents. This showcases the robustness and scale of the AI Crypto News solution in production.

# API Reference

## AI News Generator API Reference

### Introduction

ChainGPT‚Äôs **AI News Generator API** is a RESTful service that allows developers to integrate AI-generated crypto news into their applications, platforms, or services. It is designed for software engineers and system integrators who need real-time blockchain and crypto news updates, enabling them to build intelligent, up-to-date interfaces with ease. This documentation focuses on the API endpoints (not the SDK or RSS feeds) and covers usage, parameters, and response formats to streamline development.

Before using the API, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* A development environment (e.g. Node.js, an IDE)
* A ChainGPT API key (obtained from the ChainGPT web app)
* Sufficient API credits in your ChainGPT account (credits are required to make API calls)

***

### Authentication

All requests to the AI News API must be authenticated with an API key. You can generate an API key by logging into the ChainGPT web application and navigating to the **API Dashboard**. Use the "Create Secret Key" feature to create a new key, and copy it for use in your application. Keep your API key secure ‚Äì do not hard-code it in public code repositories. It‚Äôs recommended to store it in an environment variable or a secret management service to avoid exposure.

**Using the API Key:** Include the API key in your request headers as a Bearer token. For example:

```
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

This header must be sent with each API request. The API expects requests and responses in JSON format, so ensure you set the `Content-Type: application/json` header in requests where you send a body (for GET requests, this is not required but including it does no harm).

***

### Axios Configuration

If you are using Axios (a popular HTTP client for Node.js/JavaScript) to interact with the API, you can set up a reusable Axios instance with the base URL and authorization header configured. This will simplify making multiple requests. For example:

```
import axios from 'axios';

const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.chaingpt.org',
  timeout: 60000,  // 60 seconds timeout
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY}`, 
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

In the above configuration, replace `process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY` with your API key (or an environment variable containing it). The base URL for all AI News API endpoints is `https://api.chaingpt.org`, and we include the `Authorization` header by default on all requests. Using an Axios instance is optional, but it helps by not repeating the base URL and headers for each call.

***

### Available Endpoint(s)

The AI News Generator API currently provides one endpoint:

#### `GET /news`

Retrieves AI-generated news articles. Without any query parameters, this endpoint returns the latest AI news across all categories. Developers can optionally filter the news by various criteria to tailor the results. The supported filters (as query parameters) include:

* **Category** ‚Äì filter news by high-level topic/category (e.g. NFT, DeFi, Blockchain Gaming, etc.)
* **Sub-Category** ‚Äì filter news by blockchain ecosystem or network (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.)
* **Search Query** ‚Äì search terms to match in the news title or description
* **Token** ‚Äì filter news related to specific cryptocurrencies or tokens (e.g. Bitcoin, BNB, Ethereum)
* **Date** ‚Äì fetch news published after a certain date
* **Sorting** ‚Äì specify sorting by publication date (newest first)

This endpoint is designed to be flexible. You can fetch all recent news or narrow down results using any combination of the above filters. All filters are provided as **query parameters** in the GET request. The next section details each available query parameter.

***

### Parameters

All query parameters for the `GET /news` endpoint are **optional**. If no parameters are specified, the API will return a default set of recent news (by default, the 10 latest articles). You can use one or many parameters to filter the results. Below is a list of all supported query parameters:

<table><thead><tr><th width="151.4609375">Parameter</th><th width="114.5859375">Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>categoryId</code></td><td>integer or array of integers</td><td><strong>Optional.</strong> Filter news by one or more <strong>category</strong> IDs. Only news belonging to the specified category(s) will be returned. For example, <code>categoryId=5</code> would retrieve news in the <em>DeFi</em> category. You can specify multiple categories by providing an array of IDs (e.g. <code>categoryId=[5,8]</code> to get news tagged as DeFi or NFT). See the <strong>Category IDs Reference</strong> below for the list of categories and their IDs.</td></tr><tr><td><code>subCategoryId</code></td><td>integer or array of integers</td><td><strong>Optional.</strong> Filter news by one or more <strong>sub-category</strong> IDs. Sub-categories typically correspond to blockchain ecosystems or networks. For example, <code>subCategoryId=14</code> filters news related to <em>Cosmos</em>. Multiple sub-categories can be specified (e.g. <code>subCategoryId=[14,22]</code> for Cosmos or Solana news). See <strong>Sub-Category IDs Reference</strong> below for all sub-category IDs.</td></tr><tr><td><code>tokenId</code></td><td>integer or array of integers</td><td><strong>Optional.</strong> Filter news by specific <strong>token</strong> IDs. This narrows results to news articles that are related to particular cryptocurrencies/tokens (for example, Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.). You can provide multiple tokens (e.g. <code>tokenId=[79,80]</code> for Bitcoin or Ethereum). Refer to <strong>Token IDs Reference</strong> below for supported token IDs.</td></tr><tr><td><code>searchQuery</code></td><td>string</td><td><strong>Optional.</strong> Keyword search term to filter news by title or description. The API will return only news articles whose title or description contain the provided query string (case-insensitive). For example, <code>searchQuery=upgrade</code> would match news with "upgrade" in the title or body.</td></tr><tr><td><code>fetchAfter</code></td><td>date string</td><td><strong>Optional.</strong> Only return news published <strong>after</strong> the specified date. The date should be in a recognizable format (e.g. <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> or ISO 8601). For example, <code>fetchAfter=2023-12-20</code> will fetch news published on or after December 20, 2023.</td></tr><tr><td><code>limit</code></td><td>integer</td><td><strong>Optional.</strong> The maximum number of news articles to return. Defaults to <strong>10</strong> if not specified. You can use this to limit the size of the result set (e.g. <code>limit=5</code> for five articles). Note that increasing this beyond 10 will increase the credit cost (see Pricing/Credits).</td></tr><tr><td><code>offset</code></td><td>integer</td><td><strong>Optional.</strong> The number of items to skip (offset) before starting to return results. This is used for pagination along with <code>limit</code>. For example, <code>offset=10&#x26;limit=10</code> would skip the first 10 results and return the next 10.</td></tr><tr><td><code>sortBy</code></td><td>string</td><td><strong>Optional.</strong> Field by which to sort results. Currently, the only supported value is <code>"createdAt"</code>, which sorts news by their creation/publish date. By default, news is sorted by newest first (most recent date).</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notes:** All filters can be combined in a single request. For instance, you could request news in the NFT category about the Ethereum network by setting both `categoryId` and `subCategoryId` accordingly. If multiple filter parameters are provided, the news must satisfy all of them (logical AND). If an array of values is provided for a parameter, the filter will match any of those values (logical OR for the values of that field). For example, `categoryId=[5,8]` returns news that are in *either* DeFi *or* NFT categories.

A successful response from the `GET /news` endpoint returns a JSON object containing the news results. The response includes an array of news articles and possibly some pagination info. Each news article in the array has the following structure (fields):

* **id** (integer): A unique identifier for the news article.
* **title** (string): The headline or title of the news article.
* **description** (string): A brief summary or excerpt of the news content. This provides a quick overview of the news.
* **categoryId** (integer): The category ID associated with this news article (e.g., 5 for DeFi, 8 for NFT, etc.). This corresponds to one of the categories listed in the Category IDs reference table below. Use this to determine the high-level topic of the news.
* **subCategoryId** (integer): The sub-category ID for the news, typically indicating a blockchain or ecosystem (e.g., 15 for Ethereum, 22 for Solana). This corresponds to one of the sub-categories listed in the reference table. If a news article is relevant to a specific blockchain or protocol, it will have the respective subCategoryId.
* **tokenId** (integer or null): The token ID if the news is specifically about a certain cryptocurrency/token (e.g., 79 for Bitcoin). This corresponds to one of the token IDs in the reference table. If the news is of general interest and not focused on a particular token, this field may be null or omitted.
* **createdAt** (string timestamp): The date and time when the news article was created/published. This timestamp is typically in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `"2024-01-15T08:30:00Z"`). You can use this to display the publication date or to sort articles by recency. (By default, results are already sorted by this field in descending order.)
* **imageUrl** (url): The image in the news article.
* **pubDate** (Date format): publish date of news article.
* **isPublished** (booleon): News article is published or not.
* **categoryId** (number): Category Id of news article.
* **subCategoryId** (number): Sub CategoryId of news article.

The response may also include some metadata for pagination if you requested a non-default limit/offset. For example, it could include fields like **total** (total number of news articles available) or echo back the **limit** and **offset** you used. (Refer to the API's latest specification for exact response format; the core part is the array of news items described above.)

### Usage Examples

Below are examples of how to use the `GET /news` endpoint with various tools.

#### Using cURL

You can test the API quickly using the command-line tool **cURL**. Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. For example, to fetch the latest 5 news articles in the *NFT* category, you could use:

```
curl -X GET "https://api.chaingpt.org/news?categoryId=8&limit=5" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

This will make a GET request to the `/news` endpoint, filtering results to category ID 8 (which is **NFT**). The `Authorization` header is included with the Bearer token. The response will be a JSON with up to 5 NFT-related news items.

#### Using Axios (JavaScript/Node.js)

In a Node.js environment, using Axios, you can call the API as follows. This example assumes you've configured the Axios instance as shown in the Axios Configuration section above:

```
// Fetch latest news about Ethereum in the NFT category (for example)
async function fetchNews() {
  try {
    const response = await instance.get('/news', {
      params: {
        categoryId: [8],        // NFT category
        subCategoryId: [15],    // Ethereum blockchain
        searchQuery: 'upgrade', // keyword to search in title/description
        limit: 5,               // limit to 5 results
        sortBy: 'createdAt'     // sort by newest
      }
    });
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

fetchNews();
```

In this Axios example, we use an `instance.get` call to `'/news'` with a params object. We filter for news in category ID 8 (NFT) that are related to sub-category ID 15 (Ethereum network), and contain the word "upgrade". We limit to 5 articles and explicitly sort by creation date (newest first). The API key is automatically attached via the Axios instance configuration. The `response.data` will contain the JSON response (as described in the Responses section above), which we then log to the console.

#### Handling Errors

If the API key is missing or invalid, or if your credits are insufficient, the API will return an error (HTTP 4xx status). Make sure to catch errors in your code. For instance, in the Axios example above, if an error occurs, it will be caught in the `catch` block and logged. The error message can help identify issues like authentication failures or invalid parameters. Always ensure your API key is correct and that you have enough credits for the call.

***

### Credits and Pricing

ChainGPT‚Äôs AI News API uses a **credit-based** pricing system. You must have credits available in your ChainGPT account to make API calls. Each request to the `/news` endpoint will deduct credits from your balance. By default, **1 credit** is deducted per API call that fetches up to 10 news articles. This means if you use the default `limit` (which is 10), the call will cost 1 credit.

If you increase the `limit` to retrieve more than 10 articles in one call, the credit cost scales proportionally. Specifically, **1 credit is charged per 10 results**. For example:

* `limit=10` (or not specifying a limit, which defaults to 10) ‚Äì costs 1 credit.
* `limit=20` ‚Äì costs 2 credits (since 20 results are fetched, equivalent to 2 batches of 10).
* `limit=25` ‚Äì costs 3 credits (the first 20 results cost 2 credits, and the additional 5 results consume another credit, as any fraction beyond each 10 results counts as a new block of 10).

The credit deduction happens per request, regardless of filters. If you make multiple requests, each will consume credits according to the number of news items requested. Ensure you have a sufficient credit balance before making calls (you can obtain and top-up credits via the ChainGPT web app).

**Note:** Generating an API key requires that you have credits in your account in the first place. If you need to increase your usage beyond the included or purchased credits, consider reviewing ChainGPT‚Äôs pricing plans or contacting the ChainGPT team for higher-volume access. Always monitor your credit usage to avoid interruptions.

***

### Category IDs Reference

When filtering news by category (using `categoryId`), use the following IDs which correspond to various high-level news topics/categories:

<table><thead><tr><th width="238.3046875">Category Name</th><th width="125.046875">ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Category Name</strong></td><td><strong>ID</strong></td></tr><tr><td>DAO</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>DApps</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>DeFi</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Lending</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Metaverse</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>NFT</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Stablecoins</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Cryptocurrency</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Decentralized</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Smart Contracts</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Distributed Ledger</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>Cryptography</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>Digital Assets</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>Tokenization</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Consensus Mechanisms</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>ICO (Initial Coin Offering)</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Crypto Wallets</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>Web3.0</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Interoperability</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Mining</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Chain Transactions</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Exchange</td><td>78</td></tr></tbody></table>

Use these IDs with the `categoryId` parameter to filter news. For example, `categoryId=8` will retrieve news categorized as **NFT**. If you want multiple categories, you can specify an array of IDs, e.g., `categoryId=[5,8]` for news that are in *DeFi* or *NFT* categories.

***

### Sub-Category IDs Reference

Sub-categories usually represent specific blockchain networks or ecosystems. The table below lists all sub-category IDs that can be used with the `subCategoryId` parameter:

<table><thead><tr><th width="257.41015625">Sub-Category (Blockchain)</th><th width="102.18359375">ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bitcoin</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>BNB Chain</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Celo</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Cosmos</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Ethereum</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Fantom</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Flow</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Litecoin</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Monero</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Polygon</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>XRP Ledger</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Solana</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Tron</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Terra</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Tezos</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>WAX</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>algorand</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>arbitrum</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>astar</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>aurora</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>avalanche</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>base</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>binance-smart-chain</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>cardano</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>celo</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>cronos</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>moonbeam</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>dep</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>ethereum</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>fantom</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>harmony</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>oasis</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>oasis-sapphire</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>ontology</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>optimism</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>other</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>platon</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>polygon</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>rangers</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>ronin</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>shiden</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>skale</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>solana</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>stacks</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>stargaze</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>steem</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>sxnetwork</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>telos</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>telosevm</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>tezos</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>theta</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>thundercore</td><td>62</td></tr></tbody></table>

Use these IDs with `subCategoryId` to filter news for specific blockchains. For example, `subCategoryId=11` will filter news related to **Bitcoin**. You can specify multiple sub-categories; for instance, `subCategoryId=[11,22]` will get news about either *Bitcoin* or *Solana*.

**Note:** Some blockchain names appear twice with different IDs (for example, *Ethereum* appears as ID 15 and also as ID 39 in this list, likewise *Celo* as 13 and 35, etc.). This is due to how the categories are defined in the system. In practice, you should use the ID that appears in the news data you receive. The higher-numbered duplicate entries exist for legacy or internal reasons. For instance, you may see news items tagged with subCategoryId 15 for Ethereum in some cases and 39 in others. Both refer to Ethereum-related news. Similarly, BNB Chain (ID 12) and Binance Smart Chain (ID 33) refer to the same network (Binance Chain), with ID 33 being the older nomenclature. It‚Äôs recommended to filter using both IDs if in doubt, or prefer the primary name‚Äôs ID.

***

### Token IDs Reference

When filtering by specific tokens or cryptocurrencies using the `tokenId` parameter, use the following token IDs. These represent popular cryptocurrencies by name and symbol:

<table><thead><tr><th width="195.02734375">Token Name</th><th width="126.99609375">Symbol</th><th width="89.51171875">ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bitcoin</td><td>BTC</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Ethereum</td><td>ETH</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Tether USD‚ÇÆ</td><td>USDT</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>BNB (Binance Coin)</td><td>BNB</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>XRP</td><td>XRP</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>USD Coin</td><td>USDC</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Solana</td><td>SOL</td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td>Cardano</td><td>ADA</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>Dogecoin</td><td>DOGE</td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>TRON</td><td>TRX</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>Toncoin</td><td>TON</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Dai</td><td>DAI</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Polygon</td><td>MATIC</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>Polkadot</td><td>DOT</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Litecoin</td><td>LTC</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>Wrapped Bitcoin</td><td>WBTC</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>Bitcoin Cash</td><td>BCH</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>Chainlink</td><td>LINK</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>Shiba Inu</td><td>SHIB</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>UNUS SED LEO</td><td>LEO</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>TrueUSD</td><td>TUSD</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>Avalanche</td><td>AVAX</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Stellar</td><td>XLM</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>Monero</td><td>XMR</td><td>102</td></tr><tr><td>OKB</td><td>OKB</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Cosmos</td><td>ATOM</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>Uniswap</td><td>UNI</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>Ethereum Classic</td><td>ETC</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>BUSD (Binance USD)</td><td>BUSD</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td>Hedera</td><td>HBAR</td><td>108</td></tr></tbody></table>

Use these token IDs with the `tokenId` query parameter to filter news about a specific cryptocurrency. For example, `tokenId=79` will retrieve news related to **Bitcoin (BTC)**. You can specify multiple tokens as well (e.g., `tokenId=[79,80]` for news about Bitcoin or Ethereum).

Each news article that is specifically about a certain token will include a `tokenId` field in its response data. If an article doesn‚Äôt have an associated token (i.e., it‚Äôs more general news or related to a blockchain rather than a specific coin), the `tokenId` might be null or omitted. The token IDs above cover many of the top crypto assets.

***

By using the above reference tables in conjunction with the query parameters, developers can precisely query the AI News Generator API for the news content that matters to their use case. The API is designed to be flexible and developer-friendly, following patterns similar to other modern APIs. For more information, support, or to manage your API usage and credits, visit the ChainGPT web app or developer documentation pages. Happy building!


# SDK Reference

## ChainGPT AI News Generator SDK Reference

The ChainGPT AI News Generator SDK provides a convenient way for developers to fetch the latest AI-related news articles in their Node.js applications. Using this SDK, you can quickly integrate up-to-date AI, crypto, and Web3 news into your platform without dealing with web scraping or data processing yourself. Key features include filtering news by category (e.g. DeFi, NFT), sub-category (specific blockchains like Ethereum, Solana), associated tokens (like ETH, BTC), keyword search, and date range. All data is delivered in real-time with minimal duplication, allowing you to stay current with relevant news while avoiding bias or noise.

***

### Installation

Install the SDK via npm or yarn. Ensure you have Node.js installed in your development environment.

```
# npm
npm install --save @chaingpt/ainews

# yarn
yarn add @chaingpt/ainews
```

This package includes TypeScript type declarations for type-safe integration. It supports both CommonJS and ESM projects.

***

### Initialization and API Key Configuration

Before using the SDK, you need to obtain an API key from ChainGPT and have sufficient credits in your account (each API call consumes credits, explained later). Follow these steps to get set up:

1. **Get an API Key:** Log in to the [ChainGPT web app](https://app.chaingpt.org/) and navigate to the **API Dashboard**. Use the "Create Secret Key" feature to generate a new API key. Copy the generated key (it will be shown only once).
2. **Add Credits:** Ensure your ChainGPT account has enough credits. Each news fetch call deducts credits from your balance, 1‚ÄØcredit per 10 results, and 1 credit per request (e.g. 25 items ‚Üí‚ÄØ3‚ÄØcredits | 3 items -> 1 credit).‚Äù
3. **Secure the Key:** Store the API key securely, for example in an environment variable. **Do not** hard-code it in public code or commit it to source control.

With the API key in hand, initialize the SDK in your Node.js project:

```
import { AINews } from '@chaingpt/ainews';

const ainews = new AINews({
  apiKey: process.env.CHAINGPT_API_KEY  // or 'YOUR_API_KEY'
});
```

This creates a new `AINews` client instance configured with your API key. You should reuse this instance for all calls. Now you're ready to fetch news articles.

***

### Using the `getNews` Method

The primary method provided by the SDK is `ainews.getNews()`, which retrieves AI news articles according to the criteria you specify. If called with no parameters (or an empty object), it will return the latest news articles across all categories.

**Basic usage example:**

```
import { AINews } from '@chaingpt/ainews';

const ainews = new AINews({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

async function main() {
  // Fetch the latest 10 AI news articles (default behavior)
  const response = await ainews.getNews({});
  console.log(response.data);
}

main();
```

In the above example, `response.data` will contain an array of news articles (by default, up to 10 articles). Each article in the array is an object with fields like title, description, etc. (see **Response Structure** below for details). The SDK returns a promise, so you can also use `.then()`/.catch() instead of `async/await` if preferred.

#### Filtering & Search Options

You can pass an object to `getNews()` with various optional parameters to filter the news results. All filters are **optional**; omit them to get a general feed. The available filters are:

* **`categoryId`** (`number[]`, optional) ‚Äì An array of Category IDs to filter news by broad category or topic (e.g. DeFi, NFT, Metaverse). Only articles belonging to the specified category(s) will be returned. For example, `categoryId: [8]` will fetch news in the *NFT* category. You can provide multiple IDs to include several categories. (See the Category IDs reference table for the list of categories and their IDs.)
* **`subCategoryId`** (`number[]`, optional) ‚Äì An array of Sub-Category IDs to filter news by specific blockchain ecosystem or network (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.). For example, `subCategoryId: [15]` will fetch news related to *Ethereum*. This lets you narrow results to a particular chain or protocol. You can include multiple IDs for multiple sub-categories. (See Sub-Category IDs for the full list.)
* **`tokenId`** (`number[]`, optional) ‚Äì An array of Token IDs to filter news by a specific cryptocurrency or token. For example, `tokenId: [80]` will fetch news associated with *Ethereum (ETH)*. Use this to get news about particular coins or tokens. Multiple token IDs can be provided. (See Token IDs for reference.)
* **`searchQuery`** (`string`, optional) ‚Äì A text keyword or phrase to search for in the news title and description. This is a free-text search filter. For example, `searchQuery: "regulation"` will return news articles whose title or description contain "regulation". Use this to find news on specific topics or keywords.
* **`fetchAfter`** (`Date` or date string, optional) ‚Äì Only return news published after the specified date/time. Provide a JavaScript `Date` object or a date string (which will be interpreted in UTC by the API). For example, `fetchAfter: new Date('2024-01-01')` will fetch news items published from January 1, 2024 onward. This is useful for getting news within a certain time range (e.g., only recent news).

You can combine multiple filters in one request. For instance, you could query for news in the NFT category about Ethereum by providing both a `categoryId` and `subCategoryId`, or include a `searchQuery` to find specific content within those filtered results.

#### Pagination & Sorting

By default, `getNews` returns the first page of results (up to 10 articles, sorted by newest first). You can control pagination and sorting with these parameters:

* **`limit`** (`number`, optional) ‚Äì The number of news articles to return (page size). Default is **10** if not specified. You can increase this to retrieve more articles in one call (e.g. `limit: 20` for 20 articles). Note that higher limits will consume additional credits (see **Rate Limits & Credits**). If you only want a small number of the latest articles, you can set a smaller limit as well.
* **`offset`** (`number`, optional) ‚Äì The number of items to skip (offset) before starting to return results. Default is **0**. This is used for pagination. For example, to get the second page of results when using a `limit` of 10, you would set `offset: 10` (skip the first 10 articles, return the next set). Similarly, `offset: 20` would fetch the third page (items 21‚Äì30), and so on.
* **`sortBy`** (`string`, optional) ‚Äì The field by which to sort the news. Currently, the only supported sort key is `'createdAt'`, which corresponds to the article's publication time. By default, results are sorted by newest (most recent) first. If not provided, the SDK will sort by `createdAt` descending. (At this time, no other sort fields are supported.)

#### Example: Filtering and Pagination

The following example shows a more advanced usage of `getNews()` combining multiple filters and pagination options. It fetches up to 10 news articles in the **DeFi** category (Category ID 5) that are related to **Ethereum** (Sub-Category ID 15), including only those published after Jan 1, 2024, and then prints out the titles of the returned articles:

```
async function main() {
  try {
    const response = await ainews.getNews({
      categoryId: [5],              // DeFi category
      subCategoryId: [15],          // Ethereum sub-category
      fetchAfter: new Date('2024-01-01'),
      searchQuery: "funding",       // search keyword in title/description
      limit: 10,                    // up to 10 results
      offset: 0,                    // start from the first result
      sortBy: 'createdAt'           // sort by newest
    });
    for (const article of response.data) {
      console.log(article.title);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching news:", error);
  }
}

main();
```

In this example, we combined a category filter (DeFi) with a sub-category (Ethereum) and a search term "funding". We also specified `fetchAfter` to get only recent news, and used the default `limit` of 10. The loop simply logs the title of each news article returned. Adjust `offset` to paginate (e.g., set `offset: 10` to get the next page of results beyond the first 10).

***

### Response Structure

The `ainews.getNews()` method returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing the data (and some metadata). The important part of the response for developers is the `data` field, which is an array of news article objects. Each news object has the following structure:

* **`id`** (`number`) ‚Äì Unique identifier for the news article (assigned by ChainGPT).
* **`title`** (`string`) ‚Äì The title or headline of the news article.
* **`description`** (`string`) ‚Äì A short summary or excerpt of the article content. This gives a quick overview of the news.
* `sourceUrl` (`string`) ‚Äì The URL of the original full news article on its source website. You can use this link to direct users to read the full article.
* **`categoryId`** (`number`) ‚Äì The category ID indicating the broad category of the news (e.g., DeFi, NFT, etc.). This corresponds to one of the categories listed in the Category IDs reference table.
* **`subCategoryId`** (`number`) ‚Äì The sub-category ID indicating the specific blockchain or ecosystem the news is related to (if applicable). This corresponds to one of the IDs in the Sub-Category IDs table. If an article is not specific to a particular blockchain, this may be `null` or not present.
* **`tokenId`** (`number`) ‚Äì The token ID of a related cryptocurrency if the article is specifically about a certain coin or token. For example, an article about Bitcoin would have `tokenId` for BTC. This corresponds to one of the Token IDs. If the news isn't about a specific token, this field may be omitted or null.
* **`createdAt`** (`string`) ‚Äì The timestamp when the news article was published (in ISO 8601 format, e.g. `"2024-01-15T09:30:00Z"`). This is used for sorting and can be treated as the publication date/time of the article.

**Example:** After calling `getNews`, you might get data like the following:

```
console.log(response.data);
```

```
[
  {
    "id": 101,
    "title": "AI-Powered Crypto Trading Platform Raises $50M in Funding",
    "description": "A new AI-driven DeFi trading platform has secured $50 million in a Series B round led by ...",
    "url": "https://www.example.com/news/ai-defi-platform-funding",
    "categoryId": 5,
    "subCategoryId": 15,
    "tokenId": 80,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-10T15:30:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 102,
    "title": "Ethereum Merge Drives Interest in Sustainable Mining Solutions",
    "description": "Post-Merge Ethereum is prompting miners to explore eco-friendly alternatives as ...",
    "url": "https://www.example.com/news/ethereum-merge-sustainable-mining",
    "categoryId": 5,
    "subCategoryId": 15,
    "tokenId": 80,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-09T08:20:00Z"
  },
  // ...more articles
]
```

Each object in the array represents one news article with the fields described above. Using these fields, you can display the news content in your application (title, description, etc.) and provide a link to the original source (`url`). The categoryId, subCategoryId, and tokenId values can be mapped to human-readable names using the reference tables below if needed.

### Error Handling

The SDK is designed to throw a consistent error type when something goes wrong. If the underlying API request fails (e.g. network issue) or returns an error status (HTTP 4xx or 5xx), the SDK will throw an `AINewsError` (a custom error class). You should catch this error to handle issues such as invalid API keys, insufficient credits, or rate-limit violations.

Here's how you can implement error handling with `AINewsError`:

```
import { AINews, Errors } from '@chaingpt/ainews';

const ainews = new AINews({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

async function main() {
  try {
    const response = await ainews.getNews({ /* your params */ });
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Errors.AINewsError) {
      // AINewsError provides a human-readable message
      console.error("AINewsError:", error.message);
    } else {
      // Other unexpected errors
      console.error("Unexpected Error:", error);
    }
  }
}

main();
```

In the example above, we import the `Errors` from the SDK to access `Errors.AINewsError`. We then wrap the `getNews` call in a try/catch. If an `AINewsError` is caught, we log the error message (which typically describes the issue). Common reasons for errors include:

* **Authentication issues:** e.g. invalid or missing API key (would result in a 401 Unauthorized).
* **Insufficient credits:** if your account has no credits, the API may refuse the request.
* **Rate limit exceeded:** if you make too many requests too quickly (see rate limits below, e.g. more than 200 per minute), the API might return a 429 Too Many Requests.
* **Server errors:** a 500 Internal Server Error or other server-side issue.

By checking `instanceof Errors.AINewsError`, you ensure you're only catching errors thrown by the SDK. You can then use `error.message` or other properties (if provided) to inform the user or take remedial action. Always ensure to handle errors to avoid unhandled promise rejections in your application.

***

### Supported Environments

The ChainGPT AI News SDK is supported in **Node.js** environments. You can use it in server-side applications, Node.js scripts, or backend services. It is written in TypeScript and transpiled to JavaScript for compatibility. Both CommonJS (`require`) and ESM (`import`) usage are supported.

At this time, the SDK is not intended for direct use in web browsers, mainly because it requires a secret API key (which should not be exposed publicly) and makes network calls to the ChainGPT API. Always keep your API key on the server side or a secure environment.

**Platform Requirements:** Any modern Node.js version (14.x, 16.x, 18.x, or later) should work. Ensure that `node` and `npm/yarn` are properly installed.

***

### Rate Limits & Credits

When using the AI News SDK, be mindful of rate limits and credit consumption:

* **Rate Limits:** The ChainGPT API allows up to **200 requests per minute** for the AI News endpoint. This means your application should not exceed roughly 3-4 requests per second on average. If you exceed this rate, you will likely receive a rate-limit error (`AINewsError` with a message indicating too many requests or an HTTP 429 status). It's good practice to implement throttling or request queuing if you plan to make a high volume of calls.
* **Credit Consumption:** Every call to `ainews.getNews()` deducts credits from your ChainGPT account. By default, **1 credit** is consumed per request (which returns up to 10 news articles). If you increase the `limit` to fetch more than 10 articles in one call, the credit cost will increase proportionally. Roughly, **1 credit is used per 10 results**. For example:
  * Requesting 10 or fewer articles (the default) costs 1 credit.
  * Requesting up to 20 articles (`limit: 20`) costs 2 credits.
  * Requesting 25 articles would cost 3 credits (rounded up, since 25/10 = 2.5). The SDK itself does not enforce or warn about credit usage, but the API will deduct the appropriate amount. Ensure your account has enough credits to cover the calls your application is making. You can check your remaining credits on the ChainGPT web app dashboard.

Keep these limits in mind to avoid unexpected failures. If you hit the rate limit frequently, consider caching results or reducing the frequency of calls. If you run low on credits, top up via the ChainGPT platform to maintain service continuity.

### Reference: Category, Sub-Category, and Token IDs

When using filtering options, you will need to know the IDs for categories, sub-categories, and tokens. Below are tables listing the available categories, sub-categories (blockchains), and tokens along with their corresponding IDs. Use these IDs in the `categoryId`, `subCategoryId`, and `tokenId` parameters to filter news.

#### Category IDs

<table><thead><tr><th width="252.515625">Category</th><th width="102.48828125">ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Blockchain Gaming</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>DAO</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>DApps</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>DeFi</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Lending</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Metaverse</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>NFT</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Stablecoins</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Cryptocurrency</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Decentralized</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Smart Contracts</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Distributed Ledger</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>Cryptography</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>Digital Assets</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>Tokenization</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Consensus Mechanisms</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>ICO (Initial Coin Offering)</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Crypto Wallets</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>Web3.0</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Interoperability</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Mining</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Chain Transactions</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Exchange</td><td>78</td></tr></tbody></table>

These are the broad news categories you can filter by. For example, use `categoryId: [8]` for NFT-related news, or `categoryId: [5]` for DeFi news. You can combine multiple category IDs in an array if needed.

#### Sub-Category IDs

The following sub-category IDs correspond to specific blockchain ecosystems or networks:

<table><thead><tr><th width="131.359375">Sub-Category</th><th width="76.51171875">ID</th><th width="123.4921875">Sub-Category</th><th width="70.87890625">ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bitcoin</td><td>11</td><td>Algorand</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>BNB Chain</td><td>12</td><td>Arbitrum</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Celo</td><td>13</td><td>Astar</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Cosmos</td><td>14</td><td>Aurora</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Ethereum</td><td>15</td><td>Avalanche</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Fantom</td><td>16</td><td>Base</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Flow</td><td>17</td><td>Binance Smart Chain</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Litecoin</td><td>18</td><td>Cardano</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Monero</td><td>19</td><td>Cronos</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Polygon</td><td>20</td><td>Moonbeam</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>XRP Ledger</td><td>21</td><td><strong>DEP</strong> (Deeper Protocol)</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Solana</td><td>22</td><td>Harmony</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>TRON</td><td>23</td><td>Oasis</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Terra</td><td>24</td><td>Oasis Sapphire</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Tezos</td><td>25</td><td>Ontology</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>WAX</td><td>26</td><td>Optimism</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td><em>Other</em> (Miscellaneous)</td><td>46</td><td>PlatON</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Steem</td><td>56</td><td>Rangers</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>SX Network</td><td>57</td><td>Ronin</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Telos</td><td>58</td><td>Shiden</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Telos EVM</td><td>59</td><td>SKALE</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Theta</td><td>61</td><td>Stacks</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>ThunderCore</td><td>62</td><td>Stargaze</td><td>55</td></tr></tbody></table>

*(Entries with blank "Sub-Category" in the table continue the list in the next column.)*

These IDs represent specific blockchain networks or ecosystems that a news article can be associated with. For example:

* Use `subCategoryId: [15]` for **Ethereum**-related news.
* Use `subCategoryId: [11]` for **Bitcoin** news.
* Use `subCategoryId: [46]` for articles that are categorized as "Other" (not specific to a major chain).

You can provide multiple sub-category IDs if an article might fall under multiple chains, but typically one sub-category is used per article. If you are unsure which sub-category an article might be in, you can omit this filter.

#### Token IDs

The following token IDs correspond to specific cryptocurrencies or tokens:

<table><thead><tr><th width="188.81640625">Token (Symbol)</th><th width="78.80859375">ID</th><th width="223.28515625">Token (Symbol)</th><th width="107.59375">ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bitcoin (BTC)</td><td>79</td><td>Polygon (MATIC)</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>Ethereum (ETH)</td><td>80</td><td>Polkadot (DOT)</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Tether USD‚ÇÆ (USDT)</td><td>81</td><td>Litecoin (LTC)</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>BNB (BNB)</td><td>82</td><td>Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>XRP (XRP)</td><td>83</td><td>Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>USD Coin (USDC)</td><td>84</td><td>Chainlink (LINK)</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>Solana (SOL)</td><td>85</td><td>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>Cardano (ADA)</td><td>86</td><td>UNUS SED LEO (LEO)</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>Dogecoin (DOGE)</td><td>87</td><td>TrueUSD (TUSD)</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>TRON (TRX)</td><td>88</td><td>Avalanche (AVAX)</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Toncoin (TON)</td><td>89</td><td>Stellar (XLM)</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>Dai (DAI)</td><td>90</td><td>Monero (XMR)</td><td>102</td></tr><tr><td>Uniswap (UNI)</td><td>105</td><td>OKB (OKB)</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Ethereum Classic (ETC)</td><td>106</td><td>Cosmos (ATOM)</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>BUSD (BUSD)</td><td>107</td><td>Hedera (HBAR)</td><td>108</td></tr></tbody></table>

Use these token IDs to filter news by specific cryptocurrency. For example, `tokenId: [79]` will retrieve news about **Bitcoin**, and `tokenId: [84]` for **USDC**. You can combine multiple token IDs in one request if you want news related to several different tokens.

**Note:** Many news articles may not be tied to a specific token (especially general news or broad topics). The token filter is most useful if you're interested in news specifically about a particular coin or project.

# RSS Reference

## ChainGPT AI News Generator RSS Reference

ChainGPT exposes a set of **public, read‚Äëonly RSS‚ÄØ2.0 feeds** that surface the latest AI‚Äëdriven crypto and blockchain news. Because the feeds are *open to the public*, you can pull them with any HTTP client‚Äîno API key, credits, or headers required.

***

### Retention window

Each feed always contains up to **30‚ÄØdays of articles**; older items roll off automatically.

***

### Feed catalogue

| Feed                | URL                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **All Crypto**      | `https://app.chaingpt.org/rssfeeds.xml`          |
| **Bitcoin (BTC)**   | `https://app.chaingpt.org/rssfeeds-bitcoin.xml`  |
| **BNB Chain (BNB)** | `https://app.chaingpt.org/rssfeeds-bnb.xml`      |

***

### Quick fetch example

```bash
curl -L https://app.chaingpt.org/rssfeeds.xml
```

The endpoint returns standard RSS 2.0 XML. Parse it with any RSS library or an XML parser in your language of choice.

***

### Best practices

* **Cache intelligently** ‚Äì the content changes as new articles publish, but the 30‚Äëday cap prevents unbounded growth.
* **Respect intervals** ‚Äì polling every 5‚Äë10 minutes is plenty for most use‚Äëcases.
* **Filter client‚Äëside** ‚Äì if you need category or token‚Äëspecific filtering beyond the four provided feeds, fetch the general feed and apply your own logic, or switch to the REST‚ÄØAPI/SDK for granular queries.

**Obtaining a ChainGPT API key and credits:** To get an API key, go to the ChainGPT API Dashboard and log in with your crypto wallet. Create a new API key and securely save the provided secret phrase (your API key). Then visit the ChainGPT Credits page to purchase credits for API usage (each tweet generation will consume one credit).

***

### Installation and setup

Follow these steps to install AgenticOS and configure it for use:

#### Step 1: Clone the repository and install Bun

First, download the AgenticOS project and set up the Bun runtime:

```bash
# Clone the AgenticOS repository
git clone https://github.com/ChainGPT-org/AgenticOS.git
cd AgenticOS

# Install the Bun runtime (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install project dependencies using Bun
bun install
```

#### Step 2: Configure environment variables

AgenticOS uses a `.env` file for configuration. Copy the example and fill in your credentials and keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file in an editor and update the values:

```bash
# .env - sample configuration
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=development

TWITTER_CLIENT_ID=your_twitter_client_id         # OAuth2 Client ID from Twitter
TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_twitter_client_secret # OAuth2 Client Secret from Twitter

ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key  # key for token encryption
ENCRYPTION_SALT=your_hex_encryption_salt         # encryption salt (hex string)
ENCRYPTION_IV=your_hex_initialization_vector     # encryption IV (hex string)

CHAINGPT_API_KEY=your_chaingpt_api_key           # ChainGPT API key for LLM & webhooks

PASSWORD_AUTH=your_secure_password               # API Authentication Password
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_SALT`, and `ENCRYPTION_IV` are used to encrypt your Twitter OAuth tokens at rest. Make sure to choose secure values and keep them private. The `PORT` can be adjusted if needed (default 8000), and `NODE_ENV` can be set to `production` when deploying.

#### Step 3: Start the server

After configuring the environment and start the AgenticOS server:

```bash
bun start    # Start the server on the specified PORT
```

The server will start listening (by default on port 8000). You are now ready to connect Twitter credentials and configure tweeting workflows.

***

### Generating Twitter OAuth tokens

To allow your agent to tweet from your Twitter account, you need to obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token and refresh token for your Twitter account. AgenticOS uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for authentication.

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a Twitter Developer App set up with OAuth 2.0. [Follow this guide](/chaingpt-v1-docs/dev-docs-b2b-saas-api-and-sdk/agenticos-framework-web3-ai-agent-on-x-open-source/twitter_developer_account_setup)

To generate your Access Token and Refresh Token, open the following URL in your browser:

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript"><strong># Access token Refresh Token Generator
</strong>   https://your-domain.com/api/login
</code></pre>

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Make sure to replace your-domain.com with your actual deployed domain (to deploy you can refer to "Deployment on Render" section).
{% endhint %}

**Now, open your browser and go to** `https://your-domain.com/api/login`. You‚Äôll be redirected to Twitter‚Äôs authorization page. Log in and authorize the app. After authorization, you‚Äôll be redirected to `https://your-domain.com/api/login/callback`.

&#x20;The page will display your access token and refresh token, along with a password input field. Enter the password you set as `PASSWORD_AUTH` in your `.env` file, then submit. You‚Äôll be redirected to the scheduling and webhook page.

***

### Automated tweeting workflows

AgenticOS supports multiple workflows for generating and publishing tweets automatically. You can schedule tweets at specific times or have tweets generated from live Web3 news updates.

#### Scheduled tweeting with Cron jobs

In this workflow, you define a schedule of tweet prompts, and AgenticOS will generate and post tweets at those times every day.

There are two methods to schedule tweets

1. **Define your schedule:** Edit the `data/schedule.json` file to specify the tweet times (UTC) and prompts. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "05:10": {
       "type": "market_insight",
       "instruction": "{{persona}} and excellent at spotting key market movements. Create a tweet (less than {{maxLength}} characters) that's a meme about crypto."
     },
     "05:30": {
       "type": "meme",
       "instruction": "{{persona}} and excellent at spotting key market movements. Create a tweet (less than {{maxLength}} characters) that's a meme about crypto."
     }
   }
   ```

   In this JSON, each key is a time in 24h UTC format (`"HH:MM"`) and the value is the prompt or topic for the tweet. You can add multiple entries for different times of day.
2. **Edit scheduler in dashboard.** You can find dashboard at https\://\<your\_domain>/

<figure><img src="https://2865549669-files.gitbook.io/@/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F02IMVe3hN17zPTDRhn1f%2Fuploads%2F8OCPfjCrY24wZhB0GK1K%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=53c781aa-6c7c-4452-8ede-4f478a74d9f2" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

AgenticOS continuously checks this schedule. At each specified time, it uses the prompt to generate a tweet via ChainGPT‚Äôs LLM and then publishes the tweet through the Twitter API. No further action is required on your part once the schedule is set; the agent will handle it daily.

### &#x20;Real-time tweeting via ChainGPT webhooks

This workflow allows your agent to tweet live updates from ChainGPT‚Äôs Web3 news service. By subscribing to content categories, your agent will receive webhook events whenever there‚Äôs news in those categories and automatically tweet about it.

There are two methods to subscribe to categories and register Webhook.

1. Using following APIs:

**Step 1: Subscribe to news categories.** Use ChainGPT‚Äôs API to subscribe your account to the categories you're interested in. First, you can retrieve the list of available categories and see which ones you‚Äôre already subscribed to:

```shell
curl -X GET "https://webapi.chaingpt.org/category-subscription/" \
  -H "api-key: <YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY>"
```

This returns a JSON array of all category IDs and names, along with your current subscriptions.

Next, subscribe to one or more categories by ID:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://webapi.chaingpt.org/category-subscription/subscribe" \
  -H "api-key: <YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"categoryIds": [2, 3]}'
```

Replace the category IDs with the ones you want to subscribe to. (For example, `2` and `3` might represent "DeFi news" and "NFT trends" ‚Äì the category list will tell you the actual topics.)

**Step 2: Register your webhook with AgenticOS.** Now that you‚Äôve subscribed to categories, instruct ChainGPT where to send the news updates. Call the AgenticOS webhook registration endpoint to register your server‚Äôs webhook URL:

```shell
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/register \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <PASSWORD_AUTH>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/"}'
```

In the JSON body, the `url` should be the public URL where your AgenticOS server is running, pointing to the `/api/webhook/` route. (The trailing slash is expected.) Make sure to include the same ChainGPT API key and PASSWORD\_AUTH in the header for authorization.

2. **To use the dashboard, navigate to:** `https://<your_domain>/live-news`

**Register Webhook:**

This step registers your webhook URL with ChainGPT‚Äôs service. On success, ChainGPT knows it should send news events to your AgenticOS.

**How it works:** After these steps, whenever ChainGPT publishes a news article in any of the categories you subscribed to, it will send an HTTP POST request to your AgenticOS webhook (`/api/webhook`). AgenticOS will receive the event (which includes information or text about the news) and automatically generate a tweet from it and post it to Twitter. This allows your Twitter account to instantly share breaking news in the Web3 space without manual intervention.

### üöÄ Deployment on Render

[![Fork on GitHub](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e6c59aa75bb429684d7dca22cb3dce19ea9f45cee82251f9c803542802c7f5a8/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6769746875622f666f726b732f436861696e4750542d6f72672f4167656e7469634f533f7374796c653d736f6369616c)](https://github.com/ChainGPT-org/AgenticOS/fork)

To deploy this application:

1. First, fork this repository using the "Fork" button
2. Copy your repository URL from the browser's address bar
3. Open a new tab and paste this URL:

   ```
   https://render.com/deploy?repo=YOUR_REPO_URL
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_REPO_URL` with your repository URL

For example, if your repository URL is `https://github.com/john-doe/AgenticOS`, you would paste:

```
https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/john-doe/AgenticOS
```

4. Configure environment variables as described in the [Configure env section](#step-2-configure-environment-variables) above
5. Wait for the deployment to complete. This may take a few minutes.
6. Once deployed, visit your domain and click on the "Refresh Token" tab in the sidebar to get twitter access and refresh token.
7. You can schedule tweets in the "Scheduler" tab and add webhooks in the "Live News" page.

***

### API reference

Below is a summary of relevant API endpoints in the AgenticOS framework and related ChainGPT APIs, along with example usage. Use these endpoints to integrate and control the tweeting agent.

#### AgenticOS endpoints (your service)

* **POST `/api/webhook/register` ‚Äì Register ChainGPT webhook**\
  Registers your AgenticOS instance to receive ChainGPT news webhooks. This endpoint should be called **after** subscribing to categories on ChainGPT.\
  **Request body:** JSON with a single field `url`, which is the fully qualified URL to your AgenticOS `/api/webhook/` endpoint.\
  **Headers:** Include your ChainGPT API key as an `api-key` header for authorization.\
  **Example:**

  ```shell
  curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/register \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <PASSWORD_AUTH>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"url": "https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/"}'
  ```

  On success, returns HTTP 200 indicating your webhook URL is registered. ChainGPT will subsequently send POST requests to the provided URL when news events occur. (AgenticOS handles incoming webhook requests at `/api/webhook` automatically ‚Äì you do not need to call `/api/webhook` yourself.)

#### ChainGPT API endpoints (external)

* **GET `/category-subscription/`** (ChainGPT Web API) ‚Äì Retrieve available news categories and current subscriptions.\
  **Headers:** `api-key: <YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY>`\
  **Example:**

  ```shell
  curl -X GET "https://webapi.chaingpt.org/category-subscription/" \
    -H "api-key: <YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY>"
  ```
* **POST `/category-subscription/subscribe`** (ChainGPT Web API) ‚Äì Subscribe to one or more categories to receive news updates.\
  **Headers:** `api-key: <YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY>`\
  **Body:** JSON object with a `categoryIds` array listing the category IDs to subscribe to.\
  **Example:**

  ```shell
  curl -X POST "https://webapi.chaingpt.org/category-subscription/subscribe" \
    -H "api-key: <YOUR_CHAINGPT_API_KEY>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"categoryIds": [2, 3]}'
  ```

  A successful response indicates you are subscribed to the specified categories. ChainGPT will send webhook events for these categories if you have a webhook registered.

***

### Project structure

The AgenticOS project is organized into the following structure:

```
AgenticOS/             (project root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ schedule.json        # Your tweet schedule configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/              # Configuration modules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/         # Express route handlers
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jobs/                # Cron job definitions for scheduling
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/              # Express route definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/            # Twitter and ChainGPT integration logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/               # TypeScript type definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/               # Utility functions (e.g., encryption)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts             # Application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example             # Example environment variables file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

Keep your `schedule.json` up to date with prompts if using scheduled tweets. The encrypted Twitter tokens will be stored in `tokens.json` (not shown above) once you add them via the API.

***

### Security considerations

AgenticOS is designed with security in mind. Here are important security notes and best practices:

* **Sensitive data encryption:** Twitter access tokens and refresh tokens are encrypted at rest using the `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_SALT`, and `ENCRYPTION_IV` you provide. Even if someone accesses the stored `tokens.json`, the tokens remain protected.
* **Secure credentials:** Never hard-code your Twitter Client Secret, access tokens, or ChainGPT API key in code. Keep them in the `.env` file (or environment variables) and do not commit that file to source control.
* **HTTPS in production:** Always serve your application over HTTPS in production, especially since it deals with OAuth tokens and receives webhooks. The Twitter OAuth redirect URI and your webhook URL should be secure (HTTPS) in a live environment to prevent interception.
* **OAuth app permissions:** Limit your Twitter app permissions to only what's necessary (for tweeting, you need read and write permissions). Protect your Twitter Developer credentials.
* **Session and state management:** In the token generation flow, use a secure session secret and consider a robust store for sessions if scaling that part. In production, ensure that the state parameter and PKCE verifier are properly handled to prevent CSRF or authorization code interception.
* **Error handling:** AgenticOS includes robust error handling. For example, if the token exchange with Twitter fails, the error from Twitter‚Äôs API is captured and returned. Ensure you monitor the server logs for any unexpected errors.
